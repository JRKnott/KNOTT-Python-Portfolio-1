This app reads the penguins dataset and allows the user to see individual penguins by their mass and what species they are.
I plan on expanding on the techniques I learned in creating this app to make more sophisticated applications in future.

The APP is accessible via URL: https://knott-python-portfolio-1-etkqphmzkkg4dsukzctgir.streamlit.app/

Users can scroll and click on the slider or drop down to see different parts of the data set.
