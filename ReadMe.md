# Semester Project - John Knott
    Currently working on creating a portfolio of interesting applications using python that will expand my knowledge of the language and front end application software. This Portfolio will showcase my knowledge and skills related to Python and data analysis.

## Basic Streamlit App

  * This app reads the penguins dataset and allows the user to see individual penguins by their mass and what species they are. I plan on expanding on the techniques I learned in creating this app to make more     sophisticated applications in future.

  * The APP is accessible via URL: https://knott-python-portfolio-1-etkqphmzkkg4dsukzctgir.streamlit.app/

*Top Grossing X-Men Characters: A treemap visualization showcasing the most profitable characters in the comic reselling market.*
  * This project cleans an X-men Comic reselling dataset using methods from the Pandas library, and visualizes the information from this dataset using resources from other libraries.
