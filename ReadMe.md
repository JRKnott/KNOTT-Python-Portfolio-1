# Semester Project - John Knott
   * Currently working on creating a portfolio of interesting applications using python that will expand my knowledge of the language and front end application software. This Portfolio will showcase my knowledge and skills related to Python and data analysis.

## Stock Market Effects of Sentiment - An Analysis

  * This app is a multi page tool for people interested in seeing Sentiment analyzers such as FinBERT and VADER in use. Understanding the nuanced effect Market Sentiment has on stock prices is complicated and requires a lot of Data, and understanding of several factors. The goal of this project is to achieve just a fraction of what is possible using sentiment analysis in relation to market trends.
  * This app has three pages:
    1. Sentiment Analysis and it's effect on Individual Stocks : User can see the relationship between sentiment relating to certain stocks on reddit posts. Visualizes proportion of sentiment compared to stock prices/
    2. Sentiment Analysis - Vader and S&P500 Close : This showcases an overlay of the S&P500 and overall DJIA news sentiment. 
    3. Vader vs. Finbert : This allows the user to see the difference in how Vader and Finbert (two sentiment analyzers) in how they process text. Also showcases an indepth token by token analysis of Vader analysis (Shown Below:)

  * This App was designed around improving interactivity and showing interesting and unique correlations between sentiment data and stock prices. 
  * This Project was a cool way to utilize what I have learned over the semester. I was able to utilize NER, a little bit of data-cleaning, aswell as the ton of useful streamlit skills I learned over the course of the semester.
  * I have a lot of interesting take aways from the analysis that I have done. For example, when looking at Tesla reddit sentiment in comparison to stock price closes, I was able to see an almost entirely negative correlation between prices and sentiment. I believe this indicates, that because of TSLA's meme stock status, hedgefunds and other investment firms, are able to outcompete retail investors, by trickign and even manipulating the market to beat these consumers. I think this is a great way of showing how Hedge funds might have reacted to past memestocks such as GameStop, and are now able to outsmart consumers.

## NER Application

  * This app allows users to either upload a file or manually type in text. Using standard NER's entityrulers from the sPaCy library, the app showcases and highlights different entities within the text such as ORG's (Organizations) and Persons.
  * It also allows for the user to input custom labels for certain text patterns. For instance, adding that Gandalf, is a Wizard. This will update the output visualization, although it is case-sensitive.
  * This project was a great learning experience in NER (Named Entity Recognition), and allowed me to learn how to use SpaCy inside of a Streamlit app to achieve some pretty unique goals. I am beginning to see more and more how I can use NER and other Machine Learning concepts to make really cool inferences from text. I want to continue to develop these skills in the future to eventually utilize these for a more investment based strategy, and hopefully be able to analyze large amounts of data such as articles, using NER and Sentiment Analysis.

## Tidy-Data Project

*Top Grossing X-Men Characters: A horizontal bar chart visualization showcasing the most profitable characters in the comic reselling market.*
  * This project cleans an X-men Comic reselling dataset using methods from the Pandas library, and visualizes the information from this dataset using resources from other libraries.
  * The knowledge I have learned through this project will allow me to effectively prepare data visualizations and make interpretations and gain insights of data in the future. I now have a lot more ways to manipulate and use data than what I could in my past Computing I EDA Final Project.
  * This will serve as a good starting point for any future data analysis projects and portfolio updates.

## Basic Streamlit App
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/300cd250-7dd9-47f4-a30c-80f468cc879b)

  * This app reads the penguins dataset and allows the user to see individual penguins by their mass and what species they are. I plan on expanding on the techniques I learned in creating this app to make more     sophisticated applications in future.
  * The experience of making this app will help me in the future when making decisions on how best to showcase my projects. While I enjoy using streamlit, I definitely need to learn more about its uses before I make it my main way of designing apps for my projects.

  * The APP is accessible via URL: https://knott-python-portfolio-1-etkqphmzkkg4dsukzctgir.streamlit.app/
