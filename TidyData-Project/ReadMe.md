Tidy-Data Project: X-Men Mutant Moneyball
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing an X-Men comic reselling dataset using Python’s Pandas library. The goal is to structure the data using tidy-data principles and visualize key insights with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

By organizing and processing this dataset, we can explore trends related to character popularity and profitability in the comic reselling market.

📚 Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the project:
