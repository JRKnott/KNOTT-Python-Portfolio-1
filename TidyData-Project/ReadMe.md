### Tidy-Data Project

## Project Overview: 

The goal of this project is to clean an X-men Comic reselling dataset using methods from the Pandas library, and visualize the information from this dataset using resources from other libraries. 

# Dependencies/Libraries:
  1. Pandas
  2. Seaborn
  3. MatPlotLib


# Instructions: 

1. Download the Main file and dataset into the same folder
2. Run using a python environment on VScode or Google Colab
3. Follow the markdown steps in the code file.

# Source of Data : X-Men Mutant Moneyball

The dataset I am using is X-Men Mutant Moneyball. It has data that showcases the amount of appearances in comics by X-Men Characters by their in universe names, aswell as the performance on sites such as Ebay and Heritage. Using this data, one can illustrate the profitability of certain characters, aswell as their general popularity. A better example of this data being visualized is in https://observablehq.com/@deepalikank/mutant-moneyball. 

I used various methods from https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf, and followed the general principles from https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf in order to organize the data to be best utilized in varying visualizations.

Below are some examples of visualizations from this project.
