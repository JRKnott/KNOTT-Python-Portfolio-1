# **Tidy-Data Project: X-Men Mutant Moneyball**  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing an **X-Men comic reselling dataset** using Python’s Pandas library. The goal is to structure the data using **tidy-data principles** and visualize key insights with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  

By organizing and processing this dataset, we can explore trends related to **character popularity** and **profitability in the comic reselling market**.  

## 📚 **Dependencies**  

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the project:  

- **Pandas** → Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** → Data visualization  
- **Seaborn** → Enhanced and aesthetically pleasing plots  

Install them using:  

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```  

## 🛠 **Setup & Instructions**  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tidy-data-mutant-moneyball.git
   cd tidy-data-mutant-moneyball
   ```  

2. Ensure the dataset (`mutant_moneyball.csv`) is stored in the same directory as the script.  

3. Run the Python script in your preferred environment (VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab):  
   ```bash
   python mutant_moneyball_analysis.py
   ```  

4. Follow the Markdown comments in the code file for explanations of each step.  

## 📊 **Dataset Source: X-Men Mutant Moneyball**  

This dataset, **X-Men Mutant Moneyball**, contains information on:  

- **Comic appearances** of various X-Men characters (by their in-universe names).  
- **Resale performance** of their comics on platforms like:  
  - 🏛 **Heritage Auctions**  
  - 🛒 **eBay**  
  - 📰 **Wizard World**  

### **Project Goals**  
- Identify the **most profitable X-Men characters** based on resale values.  
- Analyze **character popularity** by the number of comic appearances.  
- Compare **profitability across different platforms and decades**.
