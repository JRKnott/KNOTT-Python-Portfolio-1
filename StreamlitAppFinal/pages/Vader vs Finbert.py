The Trump administration restricted the shipment of Nvidia's H20 chips to China without a license last month, leading to a $5.5 billion quarterly charge.
"Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now," Huang said at ServiceNow's Knowledge 2025 conference in Las Vegas.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday that China's artificial intelligence market will likely reach about $50 billion in the next two to three years, and that missing out on it would be a "tremendous loss."

Huang said being able to sell into China would bring back revenue, taxes, and "create lots of jobs here in the United States."

"We just have to stay agile," Huang told CNBC's Jon Fortt, in an interview alongside ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott. The tech execs were in Las Vegas for ServiceNow's Knowledge 2025 conference. "Whatever the policies are of the government, whatever is in the best interest of our country, we'll support," Huang said."""
