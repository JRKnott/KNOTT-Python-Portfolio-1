# Streamlit App Final

## Project Overview

This Streamlit app explores how sentiment compiled from Reddit, and DJIA News (Dow Jones Industrial Average) influences individual stock performance, particularly high-profile stocks like Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL). The app uses FinBERT‚Äîa financial sentiment analysis model‚Äîto evaluate Reddit post sentiment and compares it with historical stock trends from Yahoo Finance.

The goal is to uncover potential relationships between social media sentiment and market behavior, especially during volatile periods or hype-driven rallies.

## Effect of Reddit Sentiment on Individual Stocks

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** YFinance may not work if rate limit is reached.

* **Stock Selector:** Choose a stock (e.g., TSLA, AAPL) to analyze.
* **Date Range Picker:** Set custom time windows to compare sentiment and price movement.

**Reddit Sentiment Analysis:**

* Fetches posts from `r/Stocks`, `r/Investing`, or `r/WallStreetBets`. Some may have limited data. Expand date range to find more.
* Analyzes using FinBERT to classify sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

**Stock Price Overlay:**

* Visualizes daily closing prices alongside average sentiment scores.

**Downloadable Plots:** Save graphs for offline analysis or presentations.

## Sentiment Analysis ‚Äì VADER (Adjusted to FinBERT) and S\&P 500 Trends

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** May take hours to run. (FinBERT is time-intensive)

*I also have a version that uses VADER. I will attach in a separate document ‚Äì John.*

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** YFinance may not work if rate limit is reached.

* Uses FinBERT to analyze over 51,000 rows of DJIA news headlines.
* **Adjust Timeframe:** Use the data dropdowns to choose which timeframe you want to analyze.

**First Visualization:** Shows the daily averaged sentiment overlaid with the closing price of the S\&P 500.



*I wanted to make this visualization easier to see, but YF rate limit made troubleshooting impossible. ‚Äì John*

**Second Visualization:** Shows binned sentiment data in relation to the average next 3 days' closing prices. This shows correlation between sentiment and price movement. *Very interesting!*

* **Select Headline:** A dropdown to select certain headlines and view their sentiment ‚Äî a fun, interactive feature.

## Vader vs. Finbert

*This was a fun comparison between the two sentiment analyzers. Due to YFinance limits, this is the only part of the code currently confirmed working. Apologies ‚Äì John*

* **User Input:** Upload a PDF or input text (note: FinBERT has a character limit).

**FinBERT Output:**

* Label: Negative
* Confidence: 0.54

**VADER Output:**

```
Overall VADER Sentiment Scores:
Negative Sentiment: 6.00%
Neutral Sentiment: 84.50%
Positive Sentiment: 9.50%
Overall Sentiment (Compound): 0.7854
Overall Sentiment: Positive
```

* This shows the sentiment of each word in the uploaded text.



**Takeaway:** Although FinBERT is more nuanced, VADER is faster and has unique advantages like flexible compound scores.
