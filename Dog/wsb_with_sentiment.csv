2021-01-29 02:07:34,"Hey All This is my first post here. Been a regular over at the sub SPACs. You guys should definitely come over. Some good DD on SPACs which end up merging with some exciting companies, such as EV/renewable energy companies, and doubling in a day on occasion, all with very minimal downside risk. I've known about this sub for a while, but I've decided to write my first post after what happened to GME which is all over the place. That is the craziest shit I've ever seen, you guys are nuts! Congrats to all those who printed alot of tendies. On to our topic for the day. First off, for those of you autists (yeah I speak the language) who do not know, a SPAC is a shell company with no operations and which raises money through IPO. It then looks for a company it decides to merge with. If both sides can strike a deal, the money raised through the SPAC is given to the target company in exchange for part ownership in that company, meaning the holders of the SPAC's shares become shareholders of the acquired company once the deal goes through. Simple enough. Now I believe there is a good chance that Vy Global Growth, a SPAC that IPO'd late September 2020, is likely to eventually merge with Reddit, thereby turning VYGG's shares into shares of Reddit. Of course this is not a sure thing (nothing is when it comes to markets), but the below reasons lend support to this likely outcome: 1- Reddit CEO Steve Huffman: The Company will consider going public in the future. Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-is-reportedly-considering-an-ipo-2017-11 2- Guess who's one of the directors in Vy Global Growth. From VYGG's prospectus: "" Steve Huffman will serve as one of our directors following the completion of this offering. Mr. Huffman is the Co-Founder, Director and CEO of Reddit, the “front page of the internet” and the sixth most visited site in the U.S."" 3- SPAC sponsors generally provide an indication as to the industries they are targeting. From the prospectus: ""We are a newly formed blank check company that intends to partner with a technology business that will benefit from our global expertise to define the future of its industry."" 4- Vy Global Growth indicates that it prefers ""Founder-led companies"" (sound familar?). From the prospectus: "" We look for businesses that are founder-led with a long-term vision."" Reddit is of course founded and currently led by none other than our Steve Huffman. 5- Link between VY Capital and Reddit: Vy Capital funded Reddit in a recent round (i.e. it owns part of it). That gives it preferential treatment in case it wanted to take it public through an associated vehicle. Source: https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio/reddit-300-millon-dollar-funding-round-tencent.html 6- Vy Global Growth indicated it is not prohibited from acquiring a stake in a company affiliated with Vy Capital. From the prospectus: ""We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with Vy Capital."" Why would they include such a clause? Probably intend to exercise",0.0

Total other consumer products revenue in Q1 2022 increased 39% year-over year to $43 million Net Earnings in Q1 2022 of $390 million, which is a $518 million improvement versus Q1 2021 Adjusted EBITDA loss in Q1 2022 was $64 million, a $29 million narrower loss versus Q1 2021 driven by higher sales and lower operating expenses. Canadian recreational sales grew 35% year-over-year, even as the industry was impacted by COVID lockdowns for much of the quarter. Canopy Growth maintained #1 market share in tracked provinces, with total market share (including Ace Valley and Supreme) of 15.2% during Q1 2022. In total Flower category, Canopy Growth also maintained #1 market share with 17.9% in Q1 2022. U.S. CBD business continues to build momentum driven by Martha Steward CBD which is now the #3 brand among all CBD supplements in the food, drug and convenience-store channel, according to IRI data for the 12 weeks ended July 11, 2021. In addition, distribution of Quatreau CBD beverages is ramping up in the U.S. Other Consumer Products brands also delivered strong growth driven by Storz & Bickel which saw sales increase by 41% year-over-year and BioSteel, which grew sales triple digits year-over-year driven by the launch of its RTD beverages. &#x200B; TLDR: Growing much faster than Analyst expected.

I placed a stop loss at above break even then decided to modify it under it was stuck like this. Then the position went way down . And couldn't sell or do anything . Then I put a limit sell down. It didn't went through or couldn't sell or anything. I was stuck with the shares. They went up after and closed green, still couldn't sell or do anything and my market order was stuck doing nothing (stock was very high volume). The after market closed, at 21:04(it even says in their app it executed at that time) It shows my position sold at the limit loss put half an hour ago. I WAS STUCK with money due to their bugged platform. I have screenshots of everything . THIS IS FUCKERY WITH US AND WE CANT LET THEM FUCK LIKE THIS Not related to GME or stuff like that I have seen many others had the same problem today and fucked them Edit: I had a useless stop loss at 1.9 when the stock was over 2 and it dumped under 1.9 , stop loss didn't trigger , couldn't modify ,couldn't place another one due to ""not having the securities "" as they are stock in their limbo system when you place limit sells and stop losses and not let you place other ones until old ones are cleared. They weren't clears thus I lost a lot due to this. Stock was NYSE and had over 100m volume , so it wasn't liquidity. Is their platform being bugged and it costed me an extra 15k in losses because my first stop loss was stuck and couldn't modify it or re open it. I emailed them a complaint requested my money back to the amount which I bought the shares. I am willing to go middle way with them accepting the difference I lost due to my first stop loss not working caused by bugged platform. You can't fuck people's money due to your system being fucked and not have repercussions. What if your broker fucked you for 200k due to their platform being fucked. It doesn't matter if is 2$ or 20k , is your money and they shouldn't let shit like this happens with you compensating for it. They win money from CFD and from spread , it is not charity They can't offer a faulty product and us losing money because is not working.

2021-03-07 05:06:11,"Hi WSB, I've seen a lot of people talking about gamma squeezes recently, but I haven't seen anyone explain the math correctly. In fact, even the recent [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/05/gamestopgamestonk-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-madness-of-crowds/) got the concept wrong. So I figured I'd sit down this fine Saturday morning and put together a post on the actual mathematics of a gamma squeeze. I'll talk about options concepts such as the Greeks, but I won't go into so much detail that you'd need to understand the [Black-Scholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) equation or anything. &#x200B; **Market makers** The first thing you need to understand is who is on the other side of your trade when you buy a call option. Typically, this is *not* some other trader or hedge fund that wants to inverse your bet. Instead, the counter-party is what we call a [market maker](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp). Market makers profit from providing liquidity to markets, *not* from taking directional positions. In practice, what this means is that market makers charge you a slight premium, and then position themselves so that no matter what happens, their premium is preserved. This positioning is called hedging. &#x200B; **How market makers hedge call options** There are infinite ways that market makers could theoretically hedge against the calls they sell. However, by far the simplest and most prevalent way is to buy some amount of shares of the underlying stock. Remember that 1 options contract = 100 actual options. ***However, here's the part I think a lot of you are misunderstanding: market makers do not buy 100 shares of the underlying for every option contract they sell you. This would not be a hedged position! This would be equivalent to the market maker having a covered call on the stock, which is a bullish/neutral strategy, and will lose money if the underlying declines!*** The last thing a market maker would ever want to do is take a bullish position on the meme stocks that they are selling you options on. So how do market makers actually hedge? To understand how market makers *actually* hedge, first you need to understand two options concepts, delta and gamma. **Delta** The *delta* of an option represents how much the option would increase if the underlying increased by $1. So a delta of 0.3 means that for every $1 the underlying stock moves up, the option will go up by 30 cents. Remember that the initial price of the call option is much less than the stock, so that 30 cent increase is a much higher % increase than the corresponding increase in the stock. As an example, you may have paid $10 for a call option with a $100 strike on a stock that is currently trading for $50. If the delta on this option is 0.5, then if the stock moves to $51 dollars, the option will be worth \~$10.50. So, the stock moves up 2%, and the option moves up 5%. A key thing to know about delta is that it is not constant. It varies based on the changes in price of the underlying stock. In fact, as you can",0.0

2021-01-31 05:24:40,"We all know that’s bullshit. But WHY do we know that’s bullshit? Well, if you’re new to investing there’s a concept called margin. Margin is essentially a line of credit given by brokerages to users to trade with. They still “own” whatever you buy with it, but you’re allowed to take profits on how you use it, paying them back with interest once you’ve made gains. If you’re not making gains, they’ll sell your stuff for you and you’ll be responsible for making up the loss. A while back, people in financial circles were freaking out because of the “influx of you inexperienced investors trading on margin”, thinking it could cause a crash from reckless investing. Of course that’s not true, because the retail investor is on the hook for these losses. What might bring down the market is institutional investors utilizing some of the strategies that they said uninformed retail investors would do. It’s hypocrisy incarnate. You’re on the hook for your margin losses, or any cash losses. They’re trying to get hedge funds OFF the hook for theirs. Here’s the thing though. Almost ANYONE could get an ABSOLUTE SHITLOAD OF MARGIN. Unemployed college students and $40k/year average people were given thousands, often tens of thousands, dollars of credit to trade with. These are essentially loans that they know very few people will actually benefit from. Loans your bank would never give you. RH didn’t give a shit, because they don’t give a shit about your risk. Once people realized buying GME with their own cash was a sure fire way to make money, they started “caring about your risk”. They’re not limiting your risk. They’re limiting your GAINS that you’d earn at the expense of hedge funds that pay them for your trading data. “Risk with a high likelihood of downside? Have at it. Risk with almost surefire insanely high upside? We’re gonna have to step in. “ Edit to add: yes, there’s also the (probably more impactful) reality that they likely didn’t have the capital they needed to facilitate these trades. My main point is that it’s SURE AS HELL not to minimize YOUR risk.",0.0

2021-04-25 01:49:49,"Here is some DD on HYPRO. I hope to hear your thoughts on this, in my opinion, very bullish company. 1. HYPRO specialises in large-scale hydrogen production (100MW). They are in the midst of demonstrating their new patented technology which takes the efficiency of hydrogen production up to 94% compared to the rest of the hydrogen industry that is lagging behind at 80%. This technology is expected to be ready for the markets in 2022. They will have the best technology in the hydrogen sector. Massive. The EU is funding companies that are able to demonstrate efficient hydrogen production in the scale of 100MW production plants. HYPRO has applied for this funding and decisions concerning the funding will come this June. HYPROs technology will take the dollar price of producing a kilogram of hydrogen to 1,2dollars compared to EUs goal of finding someone who can produce it for 2,5€/kg of hydrogen. Almost hard to believe.. 2. In Q4 of 2020 HYPRO made an operating profit, which is pretty unheard of in the hydrogen industry. Everyone else is taking losses. 3. HYPRO has no debt. 4. HYPRO just signed a deal with Hynion about supplying hydrogen to 30 hydrogen fueling stations that will be built in Scandinavia in the coming years. Hundreds of trucks delivering goods will be charged in these stations. HYPRO and Hynion in collaboration are the only ones providing hydrogen fueling stations in the near future and will have an advantage on everyone else. 5. HYPRO is in a huge dip and hasn´t soared 1000% like some other companies like PLUG. 6. They are helping energy giant Repsol to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050. They are working on a 100MW hydrogen plant in Spain and many more projects may follow. 3 other plants are being constructed, 2 of which are in the US and 1 in France. &#x200B; Here is their most recent report on their website where most of my claims are from: [https://hydrogen-pro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HydrogenPro-Q4-2020-Report-and-Company-update-22FEB21.pdf](https://hydrogen-pro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HydrogenPro-Q4-2020-Report-and-Company-update-22FEB21.pdf) Positions: 1049 shares with an average of 46,76NOK Do your now research and let me know what you think! It's still a small company but to me that means a lot of growth potential. Weather you think hydrogen is the future or not, the EU has lots of plans in the hydrogen sector and the price of it is coming down fast. Up to 6GWs of hydrogen plants are to be built by 2024. HYPRO could take a good portion of that. The steel industry will also want to get rid of emissions when the price of pollution becomes greater than the price of switching to hydrogen.",1.0
2021-01-30 16:53:57,"So, I went digging through LEAPs for GME, cause I am retarded. &#x200B; I noticed the premium for selling a call way out, say January 2023, is 320.5, on the $2 strike So now, shares of GME are 312. So in theory, if I took my $31,200 and bought 100 shares, and sold the $2 call, even if I just met the ask, I get 320 premium. So my 31200 becomes 32000, and eventually 32200 after the call expires and I get an extra 200. But essentially I turned 31200 into 32000 with no effort. So 800 per contract sold. Obviously volume is low, but say I could do this 200x (which according to asks, it's 320.5), that's 850 profit per contract (32,050-31200). So now I can take my 32050 and do the same, and eventually, after 36th one sold, I can then start selling 2, etc. And after my 200th, which takes up all the volume for the ones that profit an average of 850, I have an extra $170,000. Obviously this cannot be correct. What am I missing? &#x200B; TLDR: &#x200B; Buy a stock for 31200, sell a covered call and get 32050. That's a profit of 850. Rinse and repeat until you have sold to all the asks over the share price, 200x. Not only are 20,000 shares locked up for a bit in long term options, but you have gained 850 profit 200x, which is 170k. &#x200B; WHAT AM I MISSING? Where does this go south? &#x200B; Edit: The answer is I forgot to account for the fact GME closed at 324, and the bid is 320. So you would lose 400 per trade. Now if it followed the meeting in the middle of the Bid ask spread then it would be a 150 profit per trade, but only 76 of those exist. Thanks u/boblawslawblawg &#x200B; Edit 2: corrected username.

The amounts of injections and immunization increased exponentially with the invention and use of this device. The reduction of plastics and needles was great too. Unfortunately, in Mid-2005 the Veterans Affairs put a stop to the devices, stating possible cross contamination exposure. Well, duh, in those days in the military they never would sanitize after each injection. I believe this CELLECTRA device from INO is going to be a revolutionary new method of immunization delivery. The other big reason this company is unvalued in my opinion. Inovio has been doing their research and discovery without the help of Big BioTech firms. They are the only independent biotech company I have found with a Covid-19 vaccine without the oversight or partnership of the big tech. Happy Hunting. Buy and Hold for your future.",0.0
2021-03-07 01:28:28,"The CEO of AMC has filed the SEC for a shareholder meeting wanting common CLASS A stock owners to vote for adding 500.000.000 new common stocks to the marked as a Way to provide more money to the business! This is by far the best thing that could happen to us right now, and I truly believe this is the final punch in the HF stomach to get them to realise that they have lost the battle!!! Listen to why: Because of the announced upcoming vote EVERY SINGLE AMC SHARE has to be accounted for and has to have an owners name and e-mail adress standing behind them at the latest 11. of march, so that AMC can send out the invitation to the shareholder meeting in the coming week after that!!! That again means that ALL THE IOU’s (fake shares) the HF have been creating to hold the share price down and make us believe that the fight is over, have to be destroyed, and that HF now will be forced to buy the actual share directly from the market (all of us) at whatever price we want! They need the shares to give it back to the stockbrokers they borrowed it from in the first place in their attempt to short the stock and drive the price down (you all know that story!!), and because they are already late on that, they now pay a shitload of interest every day!!!! What ever else you read about this issue, many bots are trying to make you believe, that the AMC CEO is screwing us right now, but I assure you, that is not the case!!!! This is a help to us to have the share-count we have been wishing for the whole time we have been in this fight!!! HOLD AND BUY, Or just HOLD for now, and only sell when the Price skyrockets!!!

2021-02-02 17:11:09,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I am just sharing what I have read all day today instead of working my day job. Please do your own research to confirm what I am going to say below. Hey traders, As Palantir's earnings is coming around the corner (estimated 2/11), their lock-up expiration will also come along at third trading session day after the ER, so estimated to be 2/14. And people who have been watching PLTR should be aware that the lock-up exp may be a huge negative catalyst as several ANALysts have been talking shit on the stock for potential unloading of 80% shares, crashing the stock price. As a techie who has deep conviction in the company and its tech (browse the sub for plenty of DDs on company's outlook), I was confused when I saw [webull's information on the stock's free float at 1.2b vs. shares outstading at 1.7b](https://imgur.com/a/o5YePOB). Does this mean the lock-up expiration will free up only >400m shares (if yes, BULLISH)? It got confusing so I decided to look into the s-1 filing specifically for the shares structure and forth. **NOTE**: This is my first time diving deep into a stock like this so **PLEASE** correct me if any part of this incorrect or too biased. I have tried my best to not skip any unclear terminology I faced along the way but in the end, I am not an analyst so I have limited knowledge. &#x200B; # [S-1 filing](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/896d430c-206d-49a4-9ffb-b83d9bf6f758.pdf) As of **September 1st, 2020**, this was the total number of shares: https://preview.redd.it/u1aprqkzc0f61.png?width=1133&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9897b7685c69f1559e95a0061f0da300b0bdd40 Ignoring/Including small figure RSUs, growth units, and exercisable options: On first trading day back in September: * 383,609,647 fully-diluted shares (including stock options) was available to trade * Registered additional 257,135,415 shares to be available to trade * Due to Investors’ Rights Agreement, they ""expected"" up to 656,018,583 shares registered additionally to be available to trade * Total: Up to 1,296,763,645 fully-diluted shares (which seems accurate according to 1.2b free float) On lock-up expiration day (estimated 2/14): * 1,863,150,291 fully-diluted shares will be available to trade * From what I understand, registering shares allow them to be available to trade so we subtract 257,135,415 and 656,018,583 shares * Adjusted: 949,996,293 fully-diluted shares * Result: Total of 2,246,759,938 fully-diluted shares. * The figure above shows 2,173,481,929 fully-diluted shares.

2021-04-14 00:10:22,"Figured I'd do a write up as I was investigating these mechanics anyway. Can't believe I have to say this shit but this isn't a guide or advice. If you want that then fuck off. before we get into it: * I'm not going to talk about volatility * I'm not going to talk about rho , vega, IV, etc * This is an oversimplified explanation. Why? because no one pays me to write these posts. Don't expect them and don't cry when I don't mention them. &#x200B; # What is Delta Neutral? Delta neutral is a portfolio strategy utilizing multiple positions with balancing positive and negative [deltas](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp) so that the overall delta of the assets in question totals zero. I'm not going to explain what delta is in any level of depth. If you don't know what it is get the fuck out of this forum and go read on the internet. We often thing of delta as a rate of change in price of our option but it's anything but static. Delta neutral is actually very simple. You sum all of your positions for a particular underlying. If it's 0 congrats you're delta neutral. Delta neutral is ideal but it's nearly impossible to maintain because price changes so often. If you're an MM that's fine you have billions at your disposal but most of us can't do that shit. Simple example: You have a put with a delta of -.3 and you have 30 shares. The short position 1 Put ( 100 \* -.3 = -30 Delta) The long position 30 shares = (30 \* +1 = 30 Delta) 30Delta (long) + -30 Delta (short) => Delta Neutral (0) Let's say the price goes down and now your put is now Delta = -.35 (gamma of -0.05) Your short position has now created a delta negative position which means you disproportionately benefit if 📉 but you get rekt if 📈. To get your position back in balance you would need to acquire 5 shares. New positions post price movement of $1 The short position 1 Put (100 \* -.35 = -35 Delta ) The long position 35 shares = (35 \* +1Delta = 35Delta) Okay great... now do it every time the price changes a dollar up or down. No surprise you can't keep doing this shit. This level of day trading isn't in the cards for most of us. Why does delta change? The closer an option is to ITM or further ITM the closer it will converge to 1:1 ratio of price change. I say converge because options can not have 0 or 1 delta. The fact that they have extrinsic value means it's impossible. Say you have a 1C on underlying that's 5000. You're $4999 ITM which means the intrinsic value of the option is going to nearly mirror the movement of the underlying price. If you have a 5000C on a call that's underlying $1. Congrats you wasted money and your delta is likely around .0001 or something stupid like that. Let's look at it graphically",0.0
2021-03-02 00:52:37,"So **$RKT** CEO Jay Farner fuckin hates shorts almost as much as we do, and im going to outline what this absolute **CHAD** has planned for them. His company RKT mortgage literally smashes every ER by a country mile and hes tired of his stock being held down by these spineless cowards. [Farner is actively going to war with them Elon style.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-ceo-not-stock-174605720.html) Let me outline how this mega-autist CEO is going to force the **shorts to squeeze themselves by 3/9.** Farner, along with company founder Dan Gilbert, and the leadership team own 95% of Rocket Companies. * Theres currently 113m shares outstanding * 38% of those shares are short * CEO/Founder own 95% of the 2B float ( note this for later ) So a quick math lesson tells us: 38% of 115m = \~ 43 mm shares short **NOW THE FUN PART** In their most recent investor meeting team $RKT rolled up to the shorts door like the dancing pallbearers and introduced a $1.11/share SPECIAL DIVIDEND to be paid to anyone holding RKT stock by 3/9. So.. what does this mean for shorts? Weve arrived at the BDE moment.. **SHORTS HAVE TO PAY THE DIVIDEND** Shorts have to pay $1.11 for every share they are short on 3/9 BUYBACK PROGRAM What else was in that juicy investor conference? Wait for it… **$1 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK PROGRAM** See, RKT makes so much fucking money they can afford not only a special divi, but a $1B share buyback. Im telling you this man is going into the trenches and clearing the shorts out by his fucking self. **TLDR:** $RKT has been suppressed for way too fuckin long, the company owns 95% of the shares and Jay Farner/Dan Gilbert hate shorts and they have diamond fuckin nuts, they aint sellin. Shorts have to cover their 43mm shares or they are **forced to pay $1.11/share they are short on 3/9**. Also, if you can’t do math.

2021-07-06 16:34:37,"Lock-up expirations are usually considered to be a negative event for a stock, as early investors get a chance to sell their shares and take their profit. The fear is that the flood of new shares coming on the market will drive the stock price down. I think this becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy in many cases, as investors sell in advance of the lock-up expiration for fear that it will go down. Not all investors sell. Some will believe in the long term vision and wait for the company to grow. Even so, some investors do cash out some portion of their shares. There’s no way to know how many shares will actually be sold once the lookup expires, but I’ve seen a number of people say 1-3%. That uncertainty is often a big factor in people getting nervous and selling as the lock-up approaches, or immediately afterwards. Some people have posited that stocks goes up after the lock-up because many institutional investors wait for the inevitable dip on lock-up expiration to enter long positions. I think this might be a case of “sell the rumor, buy the news.” Most stocks sell off prior to lock-up expirations, as investors worry that investors will unload their shares. Once the lockup is out of the way, it can actually become a tailwind for the stock if conditions are right. If insiders aren’t selling, lock-up expirations can benefit the stock, leading to significantly higher prices for in the subsequent weeks. **Palentir ($PLTR)** Many investors are gun-shy after companies like Palentir got hit hard on lock-up expiration. PLTR was an unusual case, though, with a massive 1.8 billion shares coming onto the market. The unlocked shares were an astounding 24 times the 30 day average volume. No matter how good a company is, it’s hard for the market to absorb those kind of numbers. Another complication was that the lock-up was effective upon release of PLTR’s quarterly earnings. Even though the numbers looked great to me, apparently wiser people on Wall Street were disappointed in the quarterly report, adding more downward pressure on the stock. PLTR stock went down 29% in the subsequent weeks, and still hasn’t gotten back to the pre lock-up expiration price. https://preview.redd.it/3ax3pzehhl971.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e8077d28eb976a2f8ec075b5452f67f9e6ddc63 PLTR Lock-up Expiration Summary — 30 Day Avg Volume: 74.33 million — Shares unlocked: 1.8 billion **— Unlocked shares as a % of Avg Volume: 2,422%** — Post Lock-up Performance: **29% Loss** **Lock-up Expiration as a Positive Catalyst** Despite the bad performance of PLTR, several other stocks booked significant gains after their lock-ups expired. WISH, NKLA and DASH all traded significantly higher after their lock-up expirations. **ContextLogic ($WISH)** WISH traded at 7.84 the day before its lock-up expired on 5/25. It had a slight dip and traded sideways for a few days, then climbed significantly. (Note: One publication erroneously reported the lockup expiration as 6/14, which could explain the second dip ahead of that date).

2021-05-09 11:43:29,Was reading this article from the Motley and saw the company has earnings Tuesday. After digging a little deeper I think they might blow them out of the water. If all is accurate this is what I found. 1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish 2. They just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of his own money 3. Completed the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow. 4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M 5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing 6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone. 7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

2021-02-22 07:56:51,"Texas is in the shitter right now. While people have power, they still need to boil water. Their utility system will most likely need to be overhauled. I looked at the wiki of the event, it was caused from a bust natural gas pipeline. The pipes probably got cold and burst, nothing crazy here, replace some pipes and get back to work. Wrong! The pipes did more than burst, they exposed the weakness in the system. Now all the pipes are just a problem waiting to happen. Wether they burst or not the public doesn’t trust them and will want them to be replaced or updated. Texas can either: - Fix it - Not give a fuck IMO after seeing what Texas did it’s hard to say what they will do. Texas already tried to blame green energy for this, so they most likely won’t be going green right now. It’s very likely we will see a huge replacement/retrofit of pipelines and it’s not just gas lines, but possibly water lines. Pipes bursted in peoples homes and it’s possible (depending on their buried depth) to have city supply lines burst as well. What type of businesses will be involved in this pipe replacement. - obviously pipe/metal manufactures - Engineering companies - Construction companies Pipe material ranges from cast iron to concrete, but I’ve seen cast iron used more often (for water). IMO Texas should move towards green energy, but I think that field is going to be extremely political. Remember they tried to blame this whole thing on green energy.

I personally believe there will be growth in the construction/engineering sector of Texas. I want to hear what other people thing about all of this. EDIT 1 What caused the situation: What caused the Texas deep freeze, from a Texan. Our deregulated power grid first and foremost. The lack of regulations meant that companies could pocket more profits and were not forced to maintain or improve power plants. As they weren't required to maintain plants, they closed a lot to keep production low and prices high. When this weather hit, demand pushed high and the operating plants were pushed to capacity. Add to this that it was more profitable to sell natural gas outside the state than inside (see shuttered plants) Then they started to fail. Failure to winterize (maintain) caused well heads to freeze up... add the limited supply of NG and there you have it. I don't know of a single burst NG pipeline that caused this level of fuckery.

2021-02-02 11:05:01,"So I've been thinking with all this bullshit about short selling: what if you owned more than 100% of a company? Thanks to short selling, it's actually possible since short selling effectively creates more shares (even ""legitimate"" short selling where shares shorted are borrowed). So how can you cash in if you own more than 100% of a company? Easy. Just gift the company some money and immediately pay it out in the form of dividends. You'll receive more from the dividends then you put in thanks to the extra shares you got from the short sellers (who have to make payments in lieu of dividends), allowing you to do the same process again with even more money. Of course, to do this you don't even need to own over 100%. You can work with other shareholders to pull off this trick too, so long as the group together owns more than 100% of the company. In short, short selling is stupid, gme to the 🌙",0.0

2021-08-09 17:56:14,"EDIT: Last night at 4am I posted this and MQ shot from $27.35 —> $29.60. Get in while you can. Firstly, forgive me in advance for the rambling nonsense I’m about to write out since I need to get around the dumb auto—mod who is going to remove my post for being 0 IQ. $MQ - Marqeta has earnings this week, and I’m bullish only because no one here has talked about $MQ at all. They’re also in a boring fucking industry, credit processing, which indicates that no one thinks about going and making a meme stock out of it. They have some pretty solid fundamentals — and the clients they’re working with include Uber, JPMorgan Chase, DoorDash, etc. They’re also going to be helping Goldman Sachs ($GS), (who is making a shit ton of money and outperforming the market, as-is) open their checking accounts before the end of the year, same thing for Affirm, who is going to eventually provide a “Buy now pay later” card that’ll be able to be used on ANY purchase, not only those available on the Affirm platform. Once Marqeta has these companies as clients, the don’t enough of a shit to go and find other card issuing solutions, since Marqeta does it all. [Marqeta’s website](https://www.marqeta.com) alone is more than enough to give me confidence that they know what they’re doing. I have no idea how credit processing works, other than that there is minimal risk for the card issuers and much more risk for both the merchant as well as the banks/those providing capital/money. Since MQ is into card/digital issuing, there’s minimal risk and downtime for consumers who fall for credit card fraud — they’re able to be issued new cards instantly, with new card numbers, which they can use right away. Plastic will be a thing of the past within a few years. According to Google and some bullshit [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/) article, in 2019, over 65% of US retail merchants accepted Apple Pay (and other NFC/digital payments). Additionally, 74 of the top 100 merchants accepted Apple Pay. Marqeta also recently partnered with Google to provide cards for their [GooglePay](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210729005273/en/%C2%A0Marqeta-To-Power-Virtual-Google-Pay-Balance-Card) platform. This will make MQ even more valuable, since consumers can get an account and start spending instantly, both online and in person. To recap: MQ is working with Uber, Google, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Affirm, and other big companies to, what is likely, permanently provide card issuing solutions for them. They literally cannot lose money. The stock is also on sale right now. Earnings estimates are expected to be negative — they’re probably going to blow past it even if it is still negative, it’ll be free money. If they go positive, this will print. So now I ask: what is the play? Weeklies are available only for next week, so 8/20 $30c ? Dirt cheap.",0.0

2021-02-14 19:19:48,"Reasons to buy T leaps/shares. 1. It’s HBO Max/HBO has gathered 41M subscribers in the US till now. It will go higher. A lot higher(although there's some difficulty in its pricing structure due to its TV ventures, but this problem will eventually be mitigated). It’s quality of programs is also subjectively better in my opinion compared to Netflix/Disney's offerings. If management decides to go bold(which they probably won't), and declares some good shit targets like Disney. You can be ready for an explosive ride. 2. 1M+ fiber optics net addition and this will go much more higher in the future. Fiber optics based internet is the real thing(if you subscribed to one, it's hard to think of anything else, kinda like display tech); unless of course you think Elon will eat this lunch in 2030. 3. After Covid-19 thingy ends at the end of 2021, it’s mobile related revenue will increase. Plus, 5g will slightly help(that's what others are saying). 4. It’s not ATH. Leaps and shares are not really that expensive. One can sell CC, after getting shares, not a terrible investment in any sense. Plus, F are not bad for this company; one could even argue that they are great, though it is not upon oneself to utter the F word. 5. Warner Media related losses will probably decline pretty quickly. 6. Their debt load is declining and would probably decline more in the coming years and quarters. Especially, expensive debt is declining. One could argue that their debt is unsustainable, but then you would also have to say TSLA's debt load is unsustainable. Everyone and their mother in the S&P 500 is loaded with debt, and if inflation truly comes after the end of 2021, having more debt is good, not bad. 7. Overall, I would say, in T's case, more doom and gloom is being priced in. Its potential is being mispriced. 8. If ever the management decides to not pay dividend any more, the stock would tumble for a bit and then skyrocket to infinity and beyond. 9. DirecTV will be probably sold. Granted it was a complete waste of time to begin with. Reasons not to buy leaps/shares. 1. It’s a dividend paying stock. Which means one can easily calculate the true price of something rather than relying on some FCF predictions which are absolutely ridiculous(one can make a serious DD with FCF calculation of TSLA with the revenue being equivalent to the GDP of Canada and FCF being something even more ridiculous). That means, as long as the company pays this huge amount of dividend, the stock would have to remain connected to reality. The meme that, ""invest for the 5% dividend, lose 10% in stock decline is kinda..."" 2. 5g investments would make it incur more debt. 3. Management expects only 1% growth in 2021. But again, my common sense tells me, when the time comes for pricing in the growth at the end of 2021, it would probably be already too late to enter. Or maybe, I am wrong. 4. There's no short",0.0

2021-02-22 05:01:20,"Positions: 1.7k shares with $15.7 average. Additionally currently holding 15C March calls anticipating a breakout. TLDR: If you're going to make a speculative bet on commercial EVs, you're best off betting on the company positioning themselves to benefit from them all. Recent catalysts and price action prime RMO for a breakout. Ticker: RMO = Romeo Power What is Romeo Power? Romeo Power produces clean energy products for commercial EVs. Their 113k squarefoot facility in CA primarily manufactures high-density battery packs for Class 8 trucks and buses, but the real value of RMO is speculative in nature based on their ambitions to expand to other vehicle Classes and be a leader in the entire commercial EV market. RMO currently has $544M in contracted revenue (Lion Electric, BorgWarner, Workhorse, Oshkosh, Nikola, BMW, etc). More interestingly, they state they currently have up to $2.2B (pending contracted revenue) under advanced negotiation. They emphasize the significance of the world's largest companies such as UPS, USPS, Amazon, Walmart, etc committing to EV fleets, as well as the significance of OEMs all developing EV programs. It's worth reminding that the Biden administration has yet to flesh out the logistics of transitioning to EV by 2035. As a California-based clean tech company (and Black owned) Romeo is poised to get favorable government assistance. With $2.2B under advanced negotiation the possibilities are exciting to say the least since these negotiations are currently undisclosed. Expect RMO stock to be buoyed by more and more announcements of partnerships and contracts. With the services RMO offers it's only a matter of time before they announce a contract with a recognizable company that will cause a breakout in the share price. Why will there be a breakout soon? RMO has been bleeding heavily after rallying to ATH of nearly $40/share after the SPAC announcement. It's been heavily shorted and bled even more after Morgan Stanley announced a $12 PT based on them not currently having profitability. This PT is such a misunderstanding of what makes RMO a desirable purchase. With $2.2B under negotiation and $544M secured I'm comfortable overlooking near term financials, and I believe other's are too, especially in today's market. RMO has pulled back to $15/share, a 100%+ discount from recent highs. On Friday (2/19) Romeo Power announced a business deal with Ecellix to develop next-gen EV battery technology by combining RMO's battery packs with Ecellix's high energy density silicon (rather than graphite) based batteries, reducing the weight of Class 8 trucks 25% and allowing for a range of 600 miles. In commercial trucking, range is everything. This is a massive improvement in Lithium Ion battery tech. Despite this amazing news, RMO only gained 4% and ended the week in the red. RMO had a strong close on Friday AH and reclaimed $15. I think $14-15 is the bottom for RMO. There's too much money under negotiation and too bright of a future for RMO. I believe RMO will reclaim $20 this week and retest $30-40 in the next couple months if any major announcement drops.",0.0

Why does this matter, you may ask? Well, take a look for yourself at this current graph of the S&P, DIX, and GEX all laid over each other: [https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix#:\~:text=The%20Dark%20Index%20(DIX)%20is,Learn%20more](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix#:~:text=The%20Dark%20Index%20(DIX)%20is,Learn%20more) As you see, currently GEX is at an ABSURDLY low -2,600,000,000 (!!) For those who may not understand how substantial this is, look at the max time period and you'll realize the only time it is lower is during the February Covid crash when it hit -2,900,000,000. Absolutely absurd, and means something is wrong with the market. What could that be you may ask (although if your reading this post you probably already know) - GME. The mother of all short squeezes, the most shorted stock in history, in an already volatile market, and just got re squeezed during the previous peak - is currently running again. Ill quote the article from above: "" If GEX is negative, MMs have to buy that amount of stock into rising prices and sell that amount of stock into falling prices. So, in short, negative GEX numbers create volatility while positive GEX numbers inhibit volatility. "" Remember when I said this is the second-lowest GEX EVER? These fucking crooks are about to get their panties squeezed until they can't breathe, all from a bunch of apes on the internet. Nothing is showing it clearer than the indexes that track these ""dark pools"" of money. &#x200B; I like the stock. &#x200B; Positions: GME, VIX calls, spy puts and AMC &#x200B; Edit (for additional info): When GEX hit the -2,900,000,000 previously, it was already about 10 days into the crash. In that time SPY dropped from \~3373 to \~2978...so far we have dropped from about 3925 to 3826... &#x200B; Edit #2 (added a TLDR on request): GEX, which measures volatility and how fucked the MM's are, is the second-lowest ever since the COVID crash (bad for MM's).

2021-04-13 11:14:34,"So, I wanted to wait a period of time before writing a update to my due diligence. Some of you might remember my last two due diligences. Well, I’m happy to say that I’ve bought more. So, let’s actually get to the meat and potatoes. If you want some theme music for how some of you people with a bad case of FUD who are holding UWMC are feeling I'd recommend Balduin & Wolfgang Lohr - Dizzy (ft. Alanna). Bonus points if you know the anime/light novel and get the meta meme within. Please note that this is based on historical monthly median single family home values in the US, that the data is non-seasonally adjusted, and that it is based on sales of existing homes. · The Median Home Price was $303,900 in January. · The Median Home Price was $317,100 in February. · In February, the supply of inventory ticked up by .1 to 2 Months indicating huge demand, and an extreme sellers-market, indicating that home prices will have increased when data in March 2021 is shed on the 25th. If you would like to do some more research, you can find the NAR data here: [Housing Statistics (nar.realtor)](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics). While it is true that existing home sales fell, it is not due to a bubble, but due to supply constraints and unrestrained demand. What you can be assured of however is five things, for Q1 of 2021: 1. On a seasonally adjusted basis, home sales have increased as you can see in the NAR data. Furthermore, the per home sale profit has increased due to month-on-month price increases. This is because originations usually cost .5-1% of a home’s value. With UWMC’s increasing margin due to its technology, gain margin should continue, and has been shown to have grown YoY. 2. UWMC has put out guidance of between $52 Billion and $57 of closed loan volume. Last quarter they had $54.7 Billion in 4Q20. On the Mad Money Interview with Cramer, the man said they were on track to land right around the middle of that. That provides, impetus for me to believe they will meet, or exceed guidance. They had Net Income of $1,001,925,000 after the impact of an estimated effective tax rate of 27% in Q4 of 2020. Total Gain Margin may be a little lower, as they are stating they will have a gain margin of 200-235 Basis Points, as opposed to 305 Basis Points in Q4 2020. 3. It is important to know that while they do refinance, their bread and butter is and always has been the purchase market. However, in 2020, however, they turned off FHA loans, and Jumbo loans out of an abundance of caution. This meant that while they made a massive $3.38 Billion in net income, their actual purchase volume decreased to $42.9 Billion, as compared to $49.8 Billion in total purchase volume in FY19. As UWMC has returned to doing these offerings, we can expect purchase volume to increase, and offset refinance volume (which is still going very strong, even if",0.0

They are available in stores like Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam's Club. The company is entirely vertically integrated which gives them a massive edge of the competition. They have been building manufacturing infrastructure since 2010. This company has great growth potential and is rapidly expanding. You might be thinking to yourself right now I'm tired of this plant based shit I don't even care if the burger is still Moo'ing on the plate, but hang with me this industry is experiencing huge growth as the younger generations eat this stuff up. ​ Finances For full year 2021, Tattooed Chef updated its guidance and expects: Revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58 to 63% compared to 2020. This guidance excludes any revenue contribution from the Karsten facility which is currently not in operation. The Company expects to update guidance when production begins at that facility in the coming months.

Now, they've hired marketing teams to get them into more retail stores, like an ex-Coca Cola national sales manager to boost marketing.

Here's some reasons why I think Airbnb ($ABNB) is ready to 🚀🚀🚀 over the next few months: * As first-world countries (where $ABNB generates most profits) have started effectively rolling out their vaccinations programs, ""staycations"" to different cities/regions within countries will go up as a lot of countries have international travel restrictions. * In addition to this, many large companies have are beginning to accept work from home policies, with employees getting tired of staying at home, and having no real reason to be in a specific location, staying in Airbnbs will become increasingly popular. * The stock started trading on IPO at around $140, and exploded to highs of $220, this is a popular stock that people can get behind. It is currently trading at $150, its a good deal right now - people seem to have forgotten about it. * Over the closure of Airbnb in many regions, I imagine the company is silently waiting for the world to open up more and have a ton of marketing campaigns ready, furthermore they have 100+ new features ([https://news.airbnb.com/2021-release/](https://news.airbnb.com/2021-release/)) ready to go. They still even managed to attain $3.4bn in revenue during the pandemic, when the world opens up, I see exponential growth on this. * I truly believe in the future, people will get bored of staying in hotels, as Airbnbs offer a more affordable and authentic experience. I not only believe the stock will explode in the next few months, but continue to grow in the next 5 years, it's a good company to hold. I have only recently started investing over the last 2 years (I only have around $1500), but this is my first DD i'd like to share with you guys, tell me what you think! **TL;DR -** $ABNB is at a good price, they have been laying dormant over the pandemic and I expect them to explode with the world slowly opening up more for travel and their new features they have been working on; they continue to innovate in the space and I think they are a good long term hold.

Obviously, a lot of things have happened since then and we’ll get to that later, but let’s first take a look at what their latest available financial position was to see how bad it was getting. Going through their 10-Q, here’s some of their Q3 highlights * Income Statement * Revenue - 120M (-85% YoY) * Operating Expenses - 795M (-39% YoY) * Net Loss - 906M * Balance Sheet * Cash & Equivalents - 418M * Current Assets - 609M * Total Assets - 10.9B * Current Liabilities - 1.59B * Total Liabilities - 13.2B * Total Equity (Deficit) - (2.3B) deficit vs 1.2B equity in Q3 2019 * Cash Flows * Operations - (772M) * Investing - (155M) * Financing - 1.08B * Raised over 1B cash from senior bond issuances * Net Cash Increase - 153M * Notes & Forward Guidance * Refinanced 87% of outstanding bonds for bonds due 2026 for higher-interest bonds w/ a principal reduction of 555M * Lenders have given relief from maintenance covenants in their bonds temporarily. Will need to increase cash flow or EBITDA back to a sufficient level by the end of March, when the relief ends, to be in compliance with the covenants or else the bondholders can make the bonds payable / due immediately, unless lenders agree to extend it * Cash burn = 388M during Q3 * Expects rent to be drastically increased starting in 2021 due to expiration of rent deferrals * 600M in convertible debt to Silver Lake * (335M) EBITDA in Q3 * **Expected to run out of cash by the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021, will require a sudden source of liquidity or increase in theatre attendance to not go bankrupt.** **Recent Events** The last point can basically sum up the important part of the 10-Q; that they’ve basically exhausted all possible sources of liquidity, and they would have most likely gone bankrupt some time early in 2021. They have a massive net deficit of 2.3B, which means that it would have been extremely likely that the shareholders would have been left with nothing in the case",0.0

2021-03-27 01:16:11,"If anyone thought that Biden would take his foot off the spending pedal after passing his 1.9T covid relief package, go ahead and put your seatbelt back on because this mother fucker is just getting started. Infrastructure has always been low hanging fruit for both the Democrats and Republicans, because who the hell is going to push back against the notion that our country needs better infrastructure? It’s currently estimated that deteriorating infrastructure costs the US family an average of $3,400 per year, and the number is only going to continue to grow. So, the only logical explanation is to immediately spend $3,000,000,000,000 in addition to the $1,900,000,000,000 that was previously spent. In case you weren’t aware, the Biden administration has already drafted up a plan called the “Build Back Better” plan and is packing it into a bazooka to blow that shit through the house and senate. Seeing how the Covid Relief bill was passed without any Republican votes or support, I don’t expect a lack of support or fiscal responsibility will stop this from passing as is. Obviously even the mention of a massive infrastructure bill will add a boost to US companies involved in infrastructure, and the passage of a bill would likely spend those companies to the moon. So here are some companies and ETFs you can buy if you want to pave the way to money town with infrastructure. $PAVE – US infrastructure ETF $CAT – Caterpillar Inc. $UNP – Union Pacific $DE – John Deere I like $PAVE for this play because their IV is low (30%) and the calls are dirt cheap.

I only wanted to sell a few shares at $500 to cover my cost basis and diamond hand the rest. I called up their trade desk to see if they would let me do it over the phone, no dice. The explanation they gave me was that it is not their call, it is the market makers that reject the orders if they try to place them that far away from last traded price. The broker claimed that the MM's have finite bandwidth on their order books, so if they allowed limit orders to get on their books that far away from the market price, then it could cause issues for people trying to trade at the market price like cancelled market orders and not getting fills at market price. Since the MM's don't think that it's possible for the price to moon that quick so there's no chance of ever being filled they don't allow those limit orders to go on their order book so they can conserve bandwidth for orders they think have a chance to be filled. Which, LOL, then why are you placing trade restrictions on 0DTE options and why does the option chain have significant volume at the $800 strike for end of this week? I did test this to see if it was true both ways. I tried to place a limit buy for GME on TDA at $1 price, and it rejected that for being too far from market price.

2021-06-22 05:11:11,"Amarin tried but it seems Generics are the new greedy pharma. From a health point of view I see this as a failure to keep people healthy. J&J suspected the in-active ingredient in the vaccine to be causing the blood clots. Imagine if Hikma generic has a similar in-active ingredient among its 20% fluctuations. This is a medication to protect the heart and the vascular system. It is not a headache med. All what Amrn needs to do when it comes to the USA market is to keep an eye on the infringements and nail them with powerful law suits. The generic is not that much cheaper any way. I don't think educated insured patients should go for the generics and I don't think pharmacies or physicians should conspire with the generic. The SC decision is not that impactful on the share price negative wise. It could have helped the shorts with a good news bounce. It is a very stable company with no debt and world-wide market awaiting. Background: Vascepa is an FDA approved drug to decrease Cardiovascular risks such as heart attacks and strokes. Vascepa is protected by 60 patents listed by the FDA. Once it hit the market, HIKMA a generic giant jumped in to harvest the market and infringe beyond the thin label granted for the generic. A federal court ruling in 2020 invalidated 6 key patents for Amarin/Vascepa. Today the case is at the Supreme Court and decision will be made about whether to re-validate the patents and stop the infringement or let the un-tested generic swamp the market and compete the validated medication out. In my opinion this is both not fair and dangerous. Dangerous because the generic is not clinically validated, the in-active ingredients side effects are not known and the stability. The public only knows that the generic is slightly cheaper and ignore the rest. The Supreme Court failed to rectify the course of justice by dismissing Amarin's patents hearing. This might pave the road for generics to harvest the hard work and the results of years of clinical trials and geopardize safety standards. Generics are allowed by the FDA to have up to 20% variation margin in their products and that the in-active ingredients in the generics are not clinically tested or proved harmless. A cheap medication that harms is more costly than a brand name that is fully tested and approved.",0.0

In the past cannabis has been thought of the next gold rush. That everyone should get “green” stocks now because it’s gonna explode. Whether they did or not back in 2018 when it was new and cool I don’t know I farted away. Thinking back now I’ve came across some findings. APHA and TLRY are beginning to merge. APHA got their shareholder votes and are now waiting for TLRY to say “I do” and get married. On April 30th is when TLRY should get the votes to merge with APHA which I believe would increase APHAs price and in the future the distributions and their clientele. With discussions on the rise about legalization (and with the way the US is going) recreational cannabis is not to far away. This business also does stuff with tobacco and alcohol I believe. I’m asking because I’ve seen the same trend in a different place. I saw that Monsanto was merging with Bayer back then so I put $1000 into Bayer and I got $11000 out and payed for college next year.

No need to be creative and interpret anything on this one - it doesn't get any clearer than this. 1.) Some of you might've seen the **Credit Suisse and William Blair Analyst Ratings for PLTR** \- Underperform with a Price Target of 20 as of February 16th 2021 (Reviewed and unchanged as of March 15th). Note that both those ratings were issued after the FY 2020 report dropped - so after seeing the 47% increase in revenues.

Now guess who loaded up massively on PLTR shares for the last reporting date. I'm talking the **BIGGEST** relative position increase for the last reporting date - they didn't just double or tripple down, they quintupled down. Unfortunately I can't get the exact number of shares - but my best guess is that it's an Overweight position at this point (Edit: It makes up for 21% of CS Asset Management LLC‘s portfolio - Check Edit 2 - wowzaaaa) [Credit Suisse with the BIGGEST relative position increase in the last reporting period - PLTR is CS Asset Management LLC‘s biggest position accounting for 21&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#37; of their Portfolio \(Check Edit 2 for more on that\)](https://preview.redd.it/3ci8uk87lfo61.png?width=1413&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=26d896e80c2f8fde57ad285d6f064a1c7e149181) Now - in which subsidiary of Credit Suisse does said analyst Chew, Yaoxian work?

2021-02-02 13:01:56,"Hello to all you **special**, *fabulous*, and unsophisticated retail traders. I believe people should view GME how they view startups and tech companies, with a focus on their future potential and how their fundamentals will enable or hinder growth, instead of focusing on their current price to earnings and short term volatility. I'm long on Gamestop because of changes in leadership, their new business strategy, and because their fundamentals are ***ACTUALLY*** ***PERFECT*** for company beginning to restructure and transform. * Considering the pandemic and overall state of electronic retailers, let's compare [Gamestop](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm) and [Best Buy](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/764478/000076447820000062/bby-20201031x10q.htm) fundamentals using their October 2020 10-Qs. BBY is much bigger than GME, isn't currently losing money, and no analysts are concerned about them going bankrupt, so how do their fundamentals compare? They both have relatively strong balance sheets for retailers in 2020, and both companies have almost identical quick ratios and networking capital ratios (.5 and 1.0). Their current distribution of their current assets is similar, but one huge positive for GME is that their current assets are 37.5% cash and about 50% inventory, which is great for companies beginning to restructure. A large cash balance grants the means to launch new company strategies, inventory obviously/hopefully means future revenue for retailers, and a conservative net AR balance in 2020 is likely for the best (not overestimating how much outstanding revenue can be collected). The majority of the current liabilities for GME are AP and accrued expenses, which is standard for commercial retail companies. However, it's more important to note relatively low levels of actual ***current*** debt, ***long term*** debt, and why the effect of operating leases on total liabilities is bullshit and stupid. [ASC 842](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/policy-positions/leases-what-investors-need-to-know) changed how leases are accounted for effective January 2019, so operating leases are now shown as current and long term liabilities. So while GMEs debt to equity ratio looks significantly worse than Best Buys, I'd argue that its actually better. Getting out of an operating lease for a small store like Gamestop is pretty easy to negotiate or buy out, not easy to get out of a lease for the massive stores Best Buy leases. Also being F500 and having a huge market cap skewers D/E considerably. GME has a ton of cash, limited debt, and operating leases that that can be exited with ***some relative*** ease if needed, so Gamestop can restructure with plenty of breathing room. * Looking at the income statement and cash flows, GME earnings are not awful given the conditions of brick and mortar stores during a pandemic. While Gamestop has a net income loss, they have good gross profits, and their gross margin is better than Best Buy. Gross margin indicates their core sales and costs of goods sold (costs directly related to revenue) are solid are fundamentally good. They just have too many general and administrative (non-revenue producing) expenses. I wonder what they could do to reduce overhead expenses of supplying and maintaining retail stores? Also, net income loss and loss in cash flows from operating activity in October 2020 was less than 2019. So",0.0

I can't in good conscience recommend anyone follow me on this, especially for a main reason I list below... We all know it, let's skip to the good stuff, shall we? Don't need any TLDR activity here... I must warn you, there are some emotional elements at play in this particular version of my DD. I am NOT a fan of organized religion. And these stocks are what we might term ""vice"" stocks. I know emotions do not often play into successful due dilligence of stocks, but there is an important element to this that COULD give Sundial a slight advantage. Read on. &#x200B; The bottom line is, Sundial Growers has been around a LOOOOONG time... well, long enough to know that a dollar and something stock that at it's greatest height only saw a $13.01 share price back in July of 2019, only to immediately drop below ten bucks a month later, never to recover again. IS there truly any hope for this stock?? &#x200B; 2021 COULD be the breakout year for Sundial... Let's take a look at a few hopefuls... &#x200B; ""According to New Frontier data, cannabis sales in the U.S. are expected to grow by 21% annually between 2019 and 2025..."" Gee, so really more of a long term expectation for Sundial. And the way it's rising and falling now, that earnings report on March 17th (NOW pushed back to March 18th, at 10:30 AM EST according to the official Sundial Growers website) is going to make investors VERY nervous... Especially if the earnings aren't ""through the roof."" What do YOU think is gonna happen? &#x200B; MY analysis is MAYBE a $2 price, IF WE'RE LUCKY... And that is all dependent on SNDL having a STELLAR breakthrough in their earnings report... But that's MY opinion, and I could be dead wrong. &#x200B; Here's what we DO know: to MY eyes, the biggest ""light at the end of the tunnel"" for Sundial is in it's economics. And it's sitting on, according the The Motley Fool, ""A monstrous cash pile."" All that money and nowhere to go, eh? Following a 74.5 million registered direct offering in early February, Sundial straight up stated in had 610 MILLION in unrestricted cash on it's balance sheet... WOW... ""An additional 89 million worth of warrants were exercised just weeks later."" Now, I don't know much about warrants, but it states Sundial has in the neighborhood of 700 million in cash to ""go shopping."" &#x200B; I'd be interested to know how much of that cash is still around as of March 17th... It's St. Patty's day folks, what better time to blow cash on some green!!! But that's not the most troubling thing on Sundial's agenda... &#x200B; In my mind, one of the reasons for Sundial's continued ""under valuation,"" as I see it, is their unsavory abundance of shares in the marketplace.

2021-07-18 05:52:57,"[Here is the post for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/) So let me get this straight.. You are bitching about people trying to make a living on 6% (not actually 6%, I'll cover that in just a minute) of the sale of your home but you are just fine with paying 15%/20% taxes on a long-term sale or up to 37% taxes on a short term sale to a government that just pisses away our tax dollars..? I believe you have the gun pointed at the wrong people here first off.... Now back to that 6%. Since the OP of the post I'm referencing is obviously very ignorant to the profession they are attempting to condemn, let me shine some light on how this shit works. No Realtor ever sees that full 6%. Ever. Let me try to smooth-brain this for you: When you list your home with a Realtor and agree to pay the 6% commission, once that house sells that 6% gets split 4 ways. Yup. 4 ways. 3% gets SPLIT between the listing brokerage and the agent who actually listed the home (how did you think brokerages make money and stay open..?) and the other 3% gets SPLIT between the buyer's agent and that agent's brokerage. Since most of these splits are commonly 50/50 (there are certainly areas of our nation where the split is even less favorable to the agent), the agent who you're trying to bitch about getting 6% is actually getting roughly 1.5% once all the money is divided up. So to sum this up, when you pay 6% on the sale of your home, your money is not going to one person's pocket and making them mega-rich like everyone apparently thinks. Your money is helping to keep 2 separate businesses running and also helping two individuals pay their bills. And don't even get me started about the monopoly Zillow is attempting to run so they can control the prices of our housing market nationwide. Zillow (who owns Trulia, DotLoop, HotPads, Buyfolio, ShowingTime, Postlets, Diverse Solutions, RentJuice, Mortech, StreetEasy, Retsly, Naked Apartments, & Bridge Interactive) is a growing cancer attempting to not only oust Realtors, but Mortgage Lenders and Property Managers as well nationwide. Stop being so ignorant about this profession before your blind ignorance comes back to haunt you. And thank a Realtor the next time you see one. EDIT: No one is making you use a Realtor at the end of the day, so for those of you who feel they aren't worth a damn, just don't use one. But I made this post in defense of Realtors from being bashed and misunderstood as people who take all your money and do nothing since everyone seems to think they pocket the full 6%. That is a lie. Anyone is free to list their house on their own, and of course you're free to use Zillow or any other platform to assist you, just keep in mind this silver lining: When you choose to use Zillow, they aren't legally bound to provide you accurate information. They have disclaimers galore",0.0

During the corona virus i remember watching daily trump task force meetings and being bear AF on spy with my puts. However im here to let everyone know who lost money and is still holding (if you can afford to lose the money). This small movement shows that we are tired of being pushed around, this movement shows that when we want fucking change we can push for change. This movement was hard, there was a lot going on and we were going up against a lot of money with broken rules in a fraudulent system. This has sent waves to other groups, for example. I am a medical student who is pursing a DO degree which has been declared on par with an MD (look it up if you want to get into the weeds but we take the same classes and standardized tests to practice along side MD's). Anyways, recently due to corona one of the exam (Step ii CS) was cancelled for MD's only. The DO's still had to pay for this exam, fly to the location, and take it. The subreddit r/medicalschool fought to call out the AACOMAS (the group responsible for DO's). With everyone at the medical subreddit seeing what you guys did here caused them to push and get the test cancelled recently. I put 10k and have lost 8k, but this is a lesson for me that and a middle finger to the rest of our country that we are tired of being pushed around by boomers who are getting comfortable in their high up positions. If you are a boomer that is taking advantage of younger generations so that your lazy ass doesnt have to do jack shit we are coming for you. We want blood.

Altria **also** has a warrant that would allow it to increase its stake in Cronos to about 55 percent at a price of $19 per share.

If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it: Overall: Everyone and their mom buys electronics at Best Buy. This has accelerated to extremes over the last quarter, positioning BBY for a huge earnings blowout on 2/25. It is a direct beneficiary of stimulus checks, and was upgraded by Bank of America with a 132, YES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO, price target just two days ago. BBY is 10$ under it's all time high and starting to moon. Check the chart, retard. Upside: BBY has cash on hand, $5.1B to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $2.2B to $5.1B. See? What did I say?) They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense. They surprised with an EPS of $2.04 last quarter vs $1.70 expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID. Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand. That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site. They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then. Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3. Well guess what, the market is already pricing in a slow Q4 for every business. There's uncertainty in this stock because of that, yet think of it: how could they have messed up extra console sales and stree-free closure of unprofitable stores? I mean, they could, which I'll go over below. Downsides: Usually my largest gripe is with the people. In this case, CEO Corie Barry is a traditional ""okay"" CEO with a few scandals under her.

2021-01-30 07:51:54,"In the last 24 hours, there have been 5 class action suits filed against Robinhood for their actions yesterday. However, 4 of those 5, the class lead is a Plaintiff that didn't own shares of the affected stocks and were people who were forbidden from buying them. They essentially boiled down to a person searching for a stock, not being able to find it, and claiming damages from that. Only one of the 5 - the one filed in the 10th Circuit, District of Colorado - is led by a Plaintiff who was actually IN these equities, sold some shares after the restriction occurred, and has actual tangible damages as a result of the trading platforms. As a result of this and the fact that this is the only one that is suing more than just Robinhood (it's also going after all the major trading platforms, Apex and Citadel), it's highly likely that this particular one is the one all the other class actions are going to get rolled into, even though the New York one was filed first. It's also the only one of the 5 led by a firm that specializes in class action. I've been in contact with the lead in this case (I'm backing it, in fact), and the firm is looking for all other people who have demonstrable losses and damages as a result of RH, TDA, Schwab et al's actions as they compile their opening salvo.

2021-07-01 18:35:50,"sup fuckers, so get this... I have been losing lots of money on options since entering into the stock market and hearing about Ryan C's move on a particular well-liked stock in December. I got jacked-titties hearing about everyone making money here on r/wallstreetbets and I was like: ""fuck... if a bunch of retards on reddit can make millions, hell so can I."" annnnnnnd I've lost **EVERY** single option trade I have entered... I've made a few 10% returns on only-stock trades but the returns from those trades were tossed back into FD and bi-weekly's that all expired worthless. YTD on my options trading (throwing shit at the wall) I have a verifiable **100% loss rate**. pretty sick huh? https://preview.redd.it/eghxc915uj871.png?width=4256&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c2fd55c39f401506b19d0f15f5e4450f57ecc6d so after losing another **K** this last week (a lot of money for me) - I am done losing. fucking done. &#x200B; how you might ask? using an option strategy 'of course' called a ""**gut-spread strangle**"". for those that don't know, a gut-spread strangle is where you buy an ITM call and an ITM put with identical expiration dates. how a strangle can profit is typically one of two possible ways: the stock rises in price enough to cover the call and put premiums (aka money back) or vice versa (price falls enough to get all money back). so essentially you are sacrificing one contract for the other. by the stock either rising high enough OR falling low enough in price, I can now slaughter which ever sacrificial option that gives me my money back. now I have covered my initial investment and I still have one near-worthless option left over. the second step of this strategy that I will be personally attempting for you ^((\*bow)) all is once the sacrificial option returns my initial investment, I will then repeat the process by entering another gut-spread strangle at current price (ideally during a low-volatility day to reduce the premium cost of the options). during the second step of this strategy I now have an ITM call, ITM put, and an OTM option that should be nearly worthless, and the reason for holding onto this OTM option is just in case the price moves back in the other direction; I will then have a DEEP ITM option and the option that should be apart of my initial investment that should be worth a little somethin' somethin. the only way this strategy doesn't work is if there is no volatility or price movement to close either option before the options' expiration dates. now if this strategy doesn't work that would be pretty bizarre due to two reasons... 1) if you place the contracts' expiration dates out far enough (months). 2) use this strategy on any stock seen in **Hot / Top** posts # # so what is negative divergence and what does this have to do with CLF? &#x200B; obv is on balance volume, the numbers don't really mean shit but typically the obv and price action ""should"" follow similar trends. this is fidelity's explanation on negative divergence with the OBV: [Negative divergence is",0.0
2021-01-30 06:17:05,"Why? Because it’s the platform that the majority of people use to trade GME. In my earlier post I explained the psychology of why the additional steps needed to find a new broker is unattractive to most new investors. By making it harder to buy shares, less people will go out of their way to buy them. Retail investing is strong because of Robinhood, it’s the ease and simplicity that attracts people. The familiarity and social proof from seeing screenshot after screen shot helps too. Names like Fidelity and Vanguard are slightly more intimidating and perceivably more “complex” when in actuality, they are not (although the UI less beginner friendly imo). Just moments ago I noticed Robinhood switched the 5 shares limit down to 1. Meaning if you own more than 1 share of GME you cannot buy anymore thus continuing to remove buying pressure. If Robinhood were to remove all buying restrictions it would enable millions of potential pent up buyers who are simply too, for lack of a better word, lazy to switch brokers. The volume has been much lower since RH’s buying restrictions, 170m+ every day from 1/22-1/26, while today less than 40m so far. We seemed to have let RH off the hook after their announcement stating that buying is turned back on when in fact, it is not, well, unless you have 0 shares, you can buy 1… for now. **We need to continue to fight to get the buying restrictions on Robinhood lifted.** Sure you can yell at people to switch brokers but I don’t think it will have nearly as big an impact as getting the restriction lifted on RH. Even with the heavy selling pressures, the hold is strong which is incredible, I am still holding too. Until the restriction is lifted, if you have a great broker that is reliable and easy to use, please drop it in the comments below for people to see! I use TD Ameritrade.",0.0

2021-03-14 12:16:03,"Smart Nio investors trade on catalysts. If you guys read my DD on NIO before the NIO Day Catalyst, you would've bought in at 38 and sold around 60 (I sold calls, but still holding my shares). Now, there are two new catalysts that are arguably even greater than the announcements at Nio Day. **1) Energy** On Nio Day, William Li announced a second-generation Battery Swap station, where users don't even have to leave their cars. The stations are also a lot cheaper to operate, with greater capacity. They can complete about 312 battery swaps per day. Imagine a world where Battery Stations replace Gas stations. What would that say about Nio? And what would happen to gas stations? Well early February, William Li met with Sinopec's CEO. Sinopec is one of the largest oil and chemicals companies in the world (2nd globally according to Forbes). They have over 30,000 gas stations. Here's the kicker: There are not so subtle rumors that Sinopec gas station will incorporate Nio Battery Swap Stations. Nio plans to have 500 battery swap stations by the end 2021, some of which may be at Sinopec's stations. The growth in revenue will accelerate. **Imagine if NIO's main source of revenue was from selling energy, rather than just cars.** It'll send Nio's share price to the moon. **2) Hong Kong Stock Exchange** Nio plans to list in the Hong Kong stock exchange around April. XPEV and LI will also be added. This is great news for Nio's stock price. An announcement about BABA listing on the HK stock exchange (around November 2019) led to its share price rising from 185 to 300 in three months. The same will happen to Nio, and even more so, because Li and Xpev's rise will bring Nio up even more due to their coupling in various EV-related ETF's. Watch out for an announcement in April. **Other thoughts:** I've noticed, increasingly, that puts bought for the purpose of hedging positions are now mostly be applied to index ETF's like SPY and QQQ. Why? Because GME's short squeeze drama nearly killed several hedge funds. Sentiment Analysis has become a household name, and all the major hedge funds track WallStreetBets to avoid stocks that are too popular. Nio is one of those stocks that boomer hf's realize is one of the popular ones on ""reddit"". Google ""top reddit stocks"" and you'll see Nio routinely mentioned (this is also why I think stocks like PLTR will no longer suffer for too long). Also Mizuho announced a Nio PT at $60, and Deutsche Bank recently released a memo stating that Nio can reach $70 in the near term. These things tell me that both retail and hedge funds are united in loving NIO stonk. We might be clear for another takeoff. **3) What to Do** The dates on these catalysts are not announced like Nio Day was. All I know is that it'll happen sometime in the next few months. To play it safe, I would buy call leaps. My price target is 70-80 by EOY. Also, load",0.0

In some cases, I’ve noticed it lose severely after earnings even when a company’s earnings exceeded expectations, for example $RKT. So I’m curious why is that?

2021-01-29 16:36:15,"I called and spoke with the Active Trader Team this afternoon and they offered me a few pieces of information that maybe will find helpful: **Limit Sell Orders Cannot Exceed 150% Of Last Price:** In other words, some on WSB have suggested setting limit sell orders of $10,000/share but that won't work (unless the price of a share last sold for \~$6,700/share). **No Plans of Margin Selling Positions But 300% Buffer Now Required:** This likely won't impact users with a portfolio with many holdings but if you use Fidelity and you went all-in on GME (using Margin) and you have $0 in cash reserves as a buffer there is a small chance they could sell some of your position \**if they feel the risk justifies it*. The gentleman said he does not expect any of this to happen but said technically it was possible. I did not fully vet the 300% requirement either. **They Will NOT Lend Shares Held in Cash:** First thing tomorrow you should call them and move any shares you have (that were purchased with Margin) into Cash holdings. This will not sell anything, this will not create any taxable event, it is simply the way they hold the shares on the ledger. \**This of course assumes you did not borrow money to buy the shares.* Example: You have an account with $X value in GME shares and you used ""Margin"" on the buy ticket to avoid any future 48-hour settlement period when your gay paper hands let you down and deprive you of an early retirement... Just call and ask them ""Can you please move my shares from Margin to Cash on the ledger?"" **FWIW, My Active Trader Pro Was Glitchy From 9:30 - 9:38 am This Morning (Thursday):** I had positions that weren't moving, values on calls from other holdings that weren't updating the price, etc. He said others had this problem and not to worry as they don't expect it to be a major issue. It honestly did not cause any problems for me but for eight minutes it was concerning to say the least.

Aka its the market place where your wife's boyfriend has to buy her jewelry because you are losing money on RKT and GME. I was researching about the sure fire way I'd devised months earlier to lose money that I'd called ""WISH calls"", which I wish I didn't have. I stumbled upon a couple o three interesting things: 1st Contextlogic's 500m shares outstaning number vs. it's current 60m float Now I have no idea hoy many shares are gonna be sold at lock up expiry, but the fact that **only 10% of the shares are the float is, at the very least, extremely worrying.** 2nd is that **at the current float** the **short interest currently sits at around 40%.** But this number is decieving, since if you considered all shares as float, short interest would be 5%, which you shouldn't, because.... 3rd **lock up expiry is 06/14/2021** Now, there's 2 scenarios, in my opinion of what will happen: 1st (the one I'm sadly invested in). Wish reports on may 12th a blowout quarter. With some traction, this will propel WISH to ATH's, thanks to the combination really high short interest, small float (around 10% of float trades every day). Imo I believe they will smash this quarter. &#x200B; 2nd (not financial advice) Wish stock behaves like your wife, (either passive agresively or going down on her bf whenever) until lock up expiration. On that day it craters to mid single digits. at that point I'm simply going all in calls on WISH.

2021-05-20 08:25:26,"For those who invest in the steel industry, you will agree that Nucor (NUE) is the best-in class of al the steel makers. The company has excellent management, owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end-markets, and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm. Its stock performance has shown its strength, with its stock price rising from $50 to over $100 in the past 3 months. Previously, I wrote about why US Steel (X) could provide 2X or 3X returns. Why I do not believe that NUE will hit $300 this year, I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio. With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs, Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year. **Nucor’s advantage** Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel, NUE operates electric arc furnaces (EAFs) to produce steel. The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron. The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel. EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand. This advantage has allowed NUE to become the #1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world. **Record breaking year** Last month, Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of $942.4 million, or $3.10 per share for the first three months of 2021. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:\~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/nucor-ceo-expects-strong-2021-after-posting-record-quarterly-profit.html#:~:text=The%20company%20recorded%20%247%20billion,mills%20segment%2C%20the%20company%20said). This was the most profitable quarter in the company’s history, and next quarter will be even better. Going forward, analyst expect the company to earn approximately $12.89 per share. These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices. Earlier this month, the price of hot rolled steel touched above $1,600/ton before pulling back. **$3 Billion share buyback** After posting record numbers, NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to $3 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low. As of the time writing this post, NUE has a $30 billion market cap, which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10% of the shares outstanding. This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized $2 billion buyback program. The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.

However, I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings (July 21, 2021).",1.0

2021-08-10 18:19:15,"TLDR : “Not a financial Advisor” doesn’t make sense you retards. “Not a financial analyst” also wouldn’t make sense. Post Listen you money-hungry smooth-brained daddy dolphin fuckers - I’ve got something to say. Most of the stuff mentioned in WSB would traditionally fall within the analyst zone - not the financial Advisor or Planner zone. The DD and TA can be well researched and adhere more to research and analysis principals rather than traditional “Financial Advisor” services. I’m a CFP (in real life) and operate a financial services practice where I interface with individuals and businesses in order to make great financial decisions. When the WSB commenter scuttled out of the gutter to type with his crabby little claws “Not a financial advisor”, it doesn’t make sense. Financial advisors rarely or never conduct this type of research. We maintain great relationships with actual people and business. We help clients take what they have, add in the tax code and get to their goals - investments, retirement, insurance (life, disability other), annuities. Business succession planning can be one of the most profitable activities in a persons life. I know CFA’s, research analysts and portfolio managers who conduct research similar to that which WSB top contributors conduct and submit. It’s actually not similar - it’s the same. The WSB researchers who produce solid DD are in fact financial analysts. So - my main point is that WSB has shit DD sometimes and that’s not financial analysis. WSB has great research and DD sometimes and that IS true financial research and analysis. It’s based in the reality and usually has sources. “Not a financial advisor” correct - also not a pine cone - we all fucking know you are not a financial advisor. “Not a financial analyst” and your DD is monkey gif based - probably. We assume if you were a financial analyst you would be working at a financial firm doing the exact same thing but posting the DD to a manager. “Not a financial analyst” - but you are actually submitting research - WRONG - you are a financial analyst. You fucking analyze finance for fun. If you wanted to get a job taking in the news and financial filings from public companies - you could. There aren’t always licenses needed to be a researcher. You don’t need to pass many tests to be on a research team. Stop flipping burgers and read up on how your passion for research could be a career. Signed - a CFP (Certified Financial Planner) who appreciates you Ass Clowns and wishes we all made more money at the day job. … Maybe I’m wrong and the good DD is actually coming from professional analysts…. end.",0.0

2021-07-06 01:29:02,"This company is revolutionary, not just on products but it’s service. Have any of you even seen NIO day and the enormous mass following on this company? Its walking in the footsteps of Apple. There are some people VOLUNTEERING to be a part of this. From its beginnings NIO has established epic foundations. Winning formula E and developing a super car (EP9) holding a lap record around the Nurburgring, more than once, might I add. Take a look at NIO House in Beijing - it is the epitome of what NIO represents. It’s a lifestyle beyond the car. NIO cars will soon have a 1000km solid state battery and incase that isn’t enough then feel free to visit one of the 300+ battery swap stations (increasing every day), 300000 fast charging stations over multiple cities in China or simply use power home 2.0. A swap station will have a fully charged battery in your car in 3minutes. They have now competed well over TWO MILLION SWAPS! This tech, while slower to scale than super chargers, is exactly what the EV market is lacking. This is one the greatest stigmas for EV, having to WAIT on your battery charging and worry about degradation. Imagine the continued scope for new service plans and flowing revenues with this model. EYE WATERING. You can walk into a NIO Space and save yourself 11k straight off the bat. We live in a subscription generation folks. Oh, and don’t forget a healthy tapped 2nd hand car market. Encore - Sinopec. As for the new ET7 sedan - Nio Partnered with NVIDIA to put their DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer dubbed ADAM into their car. This supercomputer, will feature four high performance Orin SoCs in each of its EVs to achieve an industry leading performance of 1,000+ TOPS!! Let me translate: that’s equivalent to 7, yes you read that correctly - SEVEN -Tesla FSD computers. A total of 11 8MP cameras, a 1,550nm LiDAR sensor, five mmWaveRad, 12 USS and two GPS / IMU as well as one V2X and one A.D.M.S sensor are installed in the NIO ET7. Aquila, is the name for the first high resolution camera (8 MP) that is installed in the vehicle. In comparison, Tesla uses a 1.2 MP camera. The higher resolution and display enables the NIO ET7 to recognize objects and obstacles at a greater distance and to let the system react accordingly. NIO underpins this with numbers, so the system is able to recognize vehicles at a distance of 687 meters; Tesla at 229 meters. Traffic cones would be seen at a distance of 262 meters (Tesla 87 meters) and people at a distance of 223 meters (Tesla 74 meters). As I said before, you also buy into a service as much as a car with NIO. LIFETIME FREE ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE. LIFE TIME FREE CAR CONNECTIVITY. UNLIMITED ON THE SPOT TYRE REPAIR AND BACKUP CHARGING CALL OUTS. LIFETIME WARRANTY WITH NO MILEAGE LIMITS. Oh, did I mention NIO house?

And now, even at $50...I am holding. This is no longer about money. This is about Good VS Evil. The average man vs the 1%. This is the fight of a lifetime. I didn't grow up rich. Every penny I made and invested I bled for. No excuses. So I write this message of hope. HOLD. HOLD THE LINE. I've seen so many post with no context. HOLD your positions because you think it's bullshit that Robinhood sold out. Melvin can manipulate the market. That the SEC continues to turn a blind eye to all that is happening. I don't even want to win back my money. I want to stick it to Melvin and every other hedge fund that rips people off. I survived 2008. I saw tons of 401ks turn into dust. And then the government bailed out the Big Banks and all the shady brokers that helped make this happen. They didn't pay for anything. They just got away with it and got even bolder. To all the people who threw in their HARD EARNED MONEY, don't despair. KARMA happens to us all. The Hedgies will get what is coming to them. Stay strong. This is no longer about riding the rocket to the moon. Paper vs Diamond hands. This is working blue collar, working white collar vs the ELITE. The establishment.

I’m not forcing or trying to convince anyone to hold. I’m simply giving my logic to why I haven’t sold yet. It’s an opinion. You either agree or disagree. The button goes up or down. Pretty simple.

Going forward, it is my opinion that all options should only be held until a week prior to expiration, should never buy OTM short term, and should always pay a little extra for the time value. Thursday and Friday is the best time to buy and the biggest dips occur on these days. Also, the greatest losses occur on these days and again, the biggest dips.

2021-04-08 15:51:44,"1. I try to keep my trading only to 10am EDT to 11am (I’ve found that if I stay in much longer trades have a greater likelihood of turning against me). 2. I watch price action before I jump in to see where prices are bouncing around and identify a channel I can hop in to. I’ll check the chart but for some reason my brain processes the actual numerals better so I like to keep an eye on SPY % changes and share price change. For example, if it is bouncing between 0.02% and 0.06%. 3. One a price channel is identified, depending on timing, I’ll buy an in the money call or put for the closest expiry date. Based on my example, I would buy the call at 0.02% or the put at 0.06%. I’ve nearly lost my ass on 0 DTEs so I prefer to have at least a day to recover if the trade moves against me, but holding overnight is really less than ideal for so many different reasons, theta decay being #1. 3. I buy to open in multiples of 10 contracts and depending on price action I’m looking to capture a .05 or .10 movement in my favor. Sometimes this happens within 10 seconds and sometimes it is a few minutes. I only trade one lot at a time and once I buy to open I will immediately input a limit sell because the price action can be so fast you cannot rely on reaction time alone to capture profits. Also, if I miss my entry because things are moving quickly, I will wait for entry or take the other side of the price channel, or wait to identify a new channel. 4. Manage risk appropriately. Size trades appropriate to preferred risk levels. If the price action gets away from the target, sometimes patience can see through to a profit; it’s a personal decision to know when it’s time to take an L and close out. Don’t be greedy or you’ll get burned. This is not financial advice and this strategy can be stressful and requires full attention and fast decision making.

The growth rate of users on dating apps worldwide has been steadily increasing: [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/) Of these, Tinder is the most popular by a significant amount; hence, I will use that as my example to illustrate some points going forward: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/) Tinder growth rate: [https://1z1euk35x7oy36s8we4dr6lo-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tinder-subscribers.png](https://1z1euk35x7oy36s8we4dr6lo-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tinder-subscribers.png) [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/) Facebook growth rate: [https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/](https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/) The tinder to Facebook comparison is not intended to illustrate that tinder could ever get into the same level of popularity of Facebook; it is much more niche. Rather, the comparison is to illustrate that the growth rates have similarities proportionally. Key factor in business model: Tinder has two primary sources of income. One of which derives from monetization, which has proven to be extremely fruitful for all social media apps thus far. Most importantly, they have a subscription based product, Tinder gold for only $15. This has proven to be extremely successful as 6 million of their total 57 million users use it. That’s 10% of their total users, that specifically chose for the paid model. To put how vast this percentage is into perspective, YouTube has about 2 billion active users, while only 1.5 million are subscribed to YouTube red for $5. What makes tinder gold differ from other traditional free app optional subscriptions: Unlike many subscriptions, tinder gold does not simply remove the ads from the UI. People are paying for two things primarily; they are first paying for the potential to have their profile be seen by others more, since it is extremely competitive. More importantly, they are also able to see the profiles of people who like them. This is a huge factor, because without it, tinder does not allow you to see who likes you. It forces you to continue swiping on random people until you stumble across someone who liked you. Due to basic human nature, people want to immediately see what people liked them, they want to cut to the chase. Therefore, they are required to sign up for tinder gold in order to see them. Another huge money maker for tinder is the profile boosters. You can pay a certain fee, in exchange for tinder’s algorithm to push your own profile into more peoples feeds for a finite period of time. This results in significantly more likes and matches. These are not points or games, these are real people, so many often get a rush from this and continue to use more and more boosts after they see how affective it is. These being only three sources of their income alone already should illustrate how advanced Tinder is in terms of marketing their products. Tinder preys on basic human nature, and it has resulted in incredible user and financial growth. Many of these other dating apps that are owned by Match include very similar marketing tactics. Again, I used tinder as an example simply because it is the most popular, and allows me to simplify some of my",0.0

GAMESTOP CORP.-1.995%/APR AMC -3.43%/APR While these rates are lower than a few weeks ago, any marked-up rates from 'general collateral' imply the securities remain hard to borrow - to some extent. There is absolutely NO GME shares to borrow and AMC requires a call to account rep, meaning shares were available earlier in AM but may be fully committed at this point in the day. At 12:30pm EST My broker got back and did offer AMC shares to borrow for shorting (if I wanted to) at a rate of 3.43% Hope this info is helpful and have a profitable day.",0.0
2021-03-09 05:46:22,"First I want to point out something that should be obvious, but by reading comments here it doesn't appear to be that obvious to many: 1. HF's who lost billions of $$ on $GME...they're not going to attempt to make those losses back on a SINGLE STOCK. Institutions don't get emotionally attached to a single stock. Now that we have that out of the way, on to the DD: # Why does $GME have these massive price swings intraday, then crash? **Answer: Because institutions are pushing the price up, selling at the top, and making millions....here is how they do it.** 1. Buy ITM calls on $GME 1. *This will appear as a ""large print"" on a number of dif. sites where people literally stare at large volume option buys all day. Typically when a huge buy comes in the options market it's an institution. It would be rare for a retail buyer to be doing 2 million dollar option buys. Often when this happens those apps / discord live chat / reddit have people saying hey look at this massive print, someone must know something.* 2. Buy OTM calls on $GME 1. *Institution will then buy deep OTM calls. This also would show up as unusual options activity, and just create a confirmation bias based on the first ITM call that got printed.* 3. Buy $GME shares 1. *Enough to get the price rolling upwards...causing momentum. When you have a stock like $GME that has eyes on it every second of the day during trading hours people notice very quickly when it's on the move. You have a collective mindset that this stock can go to $800 / share, $1,000 / share $10,000 / share ....or $420,000.69 / share. So when the price gets rolling people FOMO buy.* **This is how an institution can get the price of something moving in the direction they want. Now how do they capitalize on it?** 1. Selling those ITM call options at a massive profit 2. Selling those OTM calls at a massive profit 3. Selling the shares, again, for a massive profit.... However, Institutions are smart, they're not going to dump everything all at once. This is why you'll get these double peaks in the recent trading days. If they sold off everything at once it would almost certainly trip the circuit breakers, that has not happened in a while. **If an institution today had bought a reasonable portion of $GME at 100,000 shares x $160, and started to sell at $200...they'd make over $4mm dollars. That + the options (and potentially buying puts when it was at $200) it would be easy to clear $20-$100mm a day on $GME with a fairly small amount of capital in terms of institutional money.** &#x200B; Again...an institution isn't trying to clear $20 billion on a single trade....you think the SEC isn't going to investigate that? But a $4mm gain... a $20mm gain? even a $100mm gain in a single day? That's nothing, happens all the time and would present zero reason for the SEC to",0.0

It is characterized by two PARALLEL lines from the highs and lows formed over the course of several days. Once a channel is formed, a breakout either up or down the channel will signal a bullish or a bearish trend. If the break is above the channel, then it is bullish (which means you should probably buy in) If the break is below the channel, then it is bearish (which means you should probably sell or short) https://preview.redd.it/iogosn3c2un61.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=81663517c33234af961a4ff9c99f029b69bfa006 We see that GME right now is in a descending channel and it can break either up or down. The breakout can happen tomorrow or in several days. We don't know. But once the price breaks the channel, we know if it will go up or down.

Here is my [DD on Chinese EVs PUTs play Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwqf5/celebrate_chinese_new_year_with_puts_on_nio_xpev/). The drop wasn't really due to any of the shit I said before (yet), everything was bleeding, but when life throws money at you, you shake dat a$$. Took profits throughout last week, can see the [Xpeng gains](https://imgur.com/x6SSu50) here and [Nio gains here](https://imgur.com/SCpGZsM). Could've been more, but I ain’t fuckin Miss Celo. **Why'd you sell pussy?** I'm just playing the dip.

Let’s check in on Q1 2021 projected PS ratios as of Friday’s close. These are going to real interesting once we get to Q1 earnings. TSLA: 15.7 NIO: 17 XPEV: 15.3 Li: 10 There were some short term catalysts in the mix that also sprayed fuel to the fire last few weeks. \- Nio missing EPS, hemorrhaging money \- XPeng stock lock up period ended \- Lackluster feb delivery numbers from both Well, how do you keep the growth story fueled? You need to grow Rev. How do you grow Rev? You need to grow deliveries. For all the reasons described in [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwqf5/celebrate_chinese_new_year_with_puts_on_nio_xpev/), I don’t see them breaking out in the sea of competition. For some reason, people think Nio and Xpeng are the only 2 EV companies in China. I did a casual forecast on deliveries for Feb. [Look at it and tell me where Nio and Xpev sits](https://imgur.com/8G5dlPt). This is not even all the smaller, upcoming players who didn't make top 20... Yes, there is a Chinese new year effect in Feb on deliveries. All the millennials head to their hometowns from big cities, gloat to their parents about how much money they made, get questioned on when they’re going to get married. Little do they know, they’ve just been in a claustrophobic 1b apartment, stroking it to Fan BingBing on the daily. Ok, I digress, in reality, Nio and Xpeng have tiny pepe order books, and if you’re actually a hot growing EV brand, CNY shouldn’t affect you that much. Just look for Feb 2020 in [the most updated deliveries chart](https://insideevs.com/news/486669/china-tesla-model-3-sales-january-2021/). (Tesla Feb 2021 numbers will be out next week, I’m betting on this). Nio’s EPS miss was no surprise if you look at their cost centers. They posted a growing, healthy vehicle margin, but tucked away a sickening amount of costs, just like your secret cum bucket. \- All their early adopters, till last month, were still getting FR33 LIFE TIME battery swaps. So much for those service Revenue dreams \- All those pretentious ass NIO houses? Prime real estate locations, yeah you bet rent is expensive AF. This doesn’t even scale, if NIO drops vehicle prices (which they need to if they want to grow) = more NIO customers = crowding NIO Houses = less desirable.

2021-02-16 04:07:52,"Hi all, You may not believe me but I actually rote this post last week and then ran out the door before I hit send. Came back and accidentally hit refresh and lost all my thoughts or should i call them marbles? Anyway here is what I tried to write last week. I am new to the jungle.. So new I don't even know what flair this should get. But I have been lurking and listening to my fellow apes. Hopefully I will be Joining you all soon. just waiting for the app to accept my money. So i can start kicking names and taking ass. So on to my prediction. There are two assumption for this to pan out. First, the Hedges do not care about the failure to deliver penalties. Either the penalties are too low or they just don't think they will be penalised by the SEC. Second, no third party will step in.. yes a shame but. I suspect they won't. The only real threat to a Hedge is if another Hedge decides to make them bleed and comes to play and buys all the remaining shares. Some of you have speculated this too... The Hedges will play the long game. They will buy low as they can and buy until it gets painful and then ladder attack down. This will continue with the aim to keep reducing the cost each week. each time they will bleed a little less. So this has happened twice in a row now. So I am even more confident. Who knows, they may even be able to do this with out using the shorted stock. But I guess they will have to use some. Do I think the court case will do anything? I can hope but I seriously doubt it. Can we make money? Hell yes! Play the margins baby. play them hard. If we join and buy low/sell high with them. Then it will not only make us $$ but it will make them bleed for longer. All you need to do is get a app with no brokerage fee. Yes they exist. I just don't have it. :(. I have gone for a regular buy and hold app. Which I am currently setting up. So i can roll in some hay too. Edit: you are right, my spelling is bad.. wooo! I do try but it takes a lot of effort.... dyslexia.. doesn’t help.. but not an excuse..

Obviously, they have been going up quite a lot in the past two or three months. I think if Biden is serious about decarbonization, nuclear energy is a must as solar/wind have trouble keeping the lights on when there's no sun/wind. Battery sure can help but at this stage, cars will starve the supply for energy storage as cars offer more bangs for the bucks for the battery manufacturers. The power outage over the past few days in TX for sure highlighted the need for some back up for wind/solar. TBH, I haven't done extensive DD but just thinking about maybe there's a macro trend here. The charts look good and seem to be setting up a big wave after years of consolidation. PS. I have roof top solar and a battery for a little more than a year (both bought from TSLA using the TSLA money I made, feels great back then, not so now as I ""loss"" a few hundred k because of this). My home was self-powered 52% during this time with solar generation in the day and battery supply during night. Sure I can put more panels and batteries to get this % higher but the marginal cost will increase sharply. At some point it gets stupidly costly. I think this is the same for the whole power grid. 100% renewable even with battery storage is just not good investment and having some more stable generation to pick up the slack in unfavorable weather will help out a lot.

2021-01-31 11:13:58,"Alright, this is going to be brutal on karma. I'm confident this will get downvoted to hell, but fuck it. Early GME holders (people who bought <$50 or so), you can keep walking. You're all most likely safe and will profit from your holdings and trades. People who're buying GME at current levels, maybe I'll be completely wrong and you'll make a million and cash out at the top and lose nothing... or maybe, I'll be right and it will be loss porn galore for days. I'm leaning towards the second. **Here's why,** GME is trading at a ridiculous premium, short squeeze or not, gamma squeeze or not. If you're buying in now, you might see a few days, or even a few weeks worth of green that will be life-changing... but most of you will end up losing to an enemy you don't even think you're playing against. I'll explain this in a bit. Right now, the general public and especially WSB consensus is that GME is going to keep squeezing because of 100%+ short interest, and that's a fundamentally valid reason, but those who are buying these GME shares, where do you think they're coming from? Here's a hint. Initially, Melvin and Shitron were the primary shorters. They shorted the stock around $10 or so, thus making their max profit $10/share if GME had gone bankrupt. But as you keep squeezing higher, and even worse, as you keep buying at higher prices... Though Melvin and Shitron would be forced to close positions with hefty losses (I say would because I don't know for a fact that they already have despite what CNBC says), many other hedge funds would've opened new ones. Now, why the fuck would they do that? Simple, you gave them an opportunity to short a stock that was worth $10 a few months back, and is now 30x that... raising potential returns by at least 30x. Of course, the stock doesn't even have to go back to $10, even at $50 or $100 newly opened shorts would see sizable returns, and the only people who get truly hurt will be the ones who longed at these ridiculous levels. Think about it., who do you think keeps lending out more shares to the retail investor? New hedge funds who previously had no skin in the game, or had a very small position at best!!! You don't think you're playing against them, but you are. The energy and focus seem so concentrated on Melvin and the gang that you don't even realize there are vultures waiting for a complete bloodbath. Eventually, time will come when profit-seekers (with long positions) will begin entering the market, or when retail investors would've exhausted their capital and the price will come tumbling down faster than gravity taking hold of vulture shit falling from the sky. It will be a matter of a few thousand shares entering and the domino effect will bring it all down in a matter of days, maybe even hours. The fuck am I trying to say? Well, I'm not",0.0

They are trying everything they can to make sure that this doesn't look the same as the VW squeeze, so that we decide that we miscalculated, or that this isn't happening. Fuck that. Remember that every day that goes by without settling their shorts they are bleeding interest payments on borrowed stock. Remember that every day that goes by without them closing their position the pressure mounts. Remember that *time is on our side, not theirs*.

2021-06-29 00:22:22,"Paysafe (PSFE) poised to beat analysts estimates TLDR : See summary at bottom With PSFE’s daily short volume often in the 40-65% range, many believe the share price is being tactically pinned down as 13F filings have steadily revealed more institutions taking large positions. Joining noted fund managers David Tepper, Aaron Cohen, Dan Loeb and Leon Cooperman, Wells Fargo’s various funds have picked up 12 million shares and Blackstone has increased their holdings by an additional 37 million shares. Some have calculated that share lockup rules have reduced the true available float to as little as 80-85 million shares, causing the most recently reported short interest of 36 millions shares to have an outsized effect. But shorts must be covered eventually. A common theory, given the regular 700K-2M block trades we’ve seen, is that aggressive shorting enables large funds to accumulate before Q2 ER (which should beat estimates) and before PSFE is added to the Russell 3000 Index next month. Goldman Sachs also anticipates Paysafe’s Russell 1000 inclusion which, in light of their projected $100+ billion in market share, would likely be followed by other benchmark funds and ETFs, carving out yet even more of the available float. Along with now priced-in fears of PE lockup expiration (more on that below), it’s clear that PSFE’s share price has also suffered from the Q1 report of YoY 5% quarterly revenue growth which, no doubt, disappointed the short-term expectations of many impatient traders invited in by constant Cramer and Steve Grasso pumps. It's understandable that, over the last few months, PSFE has reportedly experienced a large demographic shift away from younger shareholders, indicating a transition to a steadier long-term investor base. But that 5% number may have been misleading to some who didn’t bother to look under the hood. Paysafe not only upgraded the low end of their 2021 revenue guidance to $1.53 billion, they beat analysts’ average estimate and they also noted that revenue growth would have been “mid to high teens” were it not for their strategic “market/channel exit to improve overall risk/reward profile.” This was not a surprise as they explained: “adjusting for the actions we have discussed in our Analyst Day and continued risk reward optimization in our business model, our revenue growth would have been in the mid to high teens.” Based on valuation comps, such a growth rate would easily support a share price double the current level. Paysafe’s quarterly revenue, gross profit and EBITDA numbers all came in at the upper range of their guidance along with a 63% gain in eCash revenue and 29% gain in free cash flow to over $108 million for Q1 alone. On the day of their earnings report, initial headlines were favorable: “Paysafe beats on revenue, Reaffirms 2021 outlook” only to be suddenly overtaken by articles almost uniformly focused on the negative, offering oddly biased summaries like: “Sees Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $110M-$120M, which means it could fall below the Q1 level of $113.2M.” (Obviously, given that range, it could just as well, if not more likely, rise above that number.)",0.0

In their latest S4 Amendment, it shows their Q3 results in 2020 vs. their Q3 results in 2019. They were able to generate almost twice as much Revenue (from $57 Million into $107 Million) and was able to reduce their marketing expense (from $49 million into $39 million) at the same time. Not only that, but they were also able to increase their gross margins from 51% into 72%.

With that said, I believe this was not just luck or sheer force of will, I think there are hidden actors on our side or, to the very least, profiting from our chaos. Why? Here we go: 1- Retail has been severely handicapped through platforms this week and, even with very few of us still active, we managed to keep the price of GME above 320. 2- During short attacks, especially the last one this Friday, someone went full blown Rambo and managed to fend off the shorters. If you look at the volume Friday in the last 5 minutes, we went 2x in volume to 600k. 3- Retail is running low on funds: most of us retards burned out our money pushing this shit up early in the week and have very few funds left, making impossible to pull these sorts of transaction. Given the above, I believe some hedge funds have entered the game to try to f**k with their competitors, make money and frame retail as the guilty party of this (potentially taking down RH in the process). If this is true, and I don't know if it is, next week we need to be extra careful to see what happens after the gamma squeeze finishes.

2021-01-31 05:24:04,"**TLDR**; taking on huge risk and betting everything makes you more prone to paper handing your position at the slightest red. Be smart about your position and your profits. 🦍🦍 💪💪, GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 Alright retards, put on your helmet and take that crayon out of your nose because it's time to get serious. Diamond handing is important. It's been the most important part of our strategy, no doubt. The concept's easy, but this volatility is enough to age us all 40 years. Not everyone, especially the newer people, are capable of stomaching these drops, so I'd like to offer a more practical (more realistic maybe) guide to diamond handing. At the very least, this guide will help you be more confident in your positions and greatly decreasing your odds of being a little bitch that sells at the first sign of red. &#x200B; **If you're just joining us now and bought any of the hyped stocks at current prices or higher:** 1. **Educate yourself.** You bought a stock, which is ownership of a company. Understand the fundamentals behind what your company. DD is not something WSB is lacking in. You have a searchbar. You have eyes. (I mean, unless you don't. That's cool too. Have someone read you DD out loud like a bedtime story. :) ) I really like [this DD on Gamestop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) if you want to learn some more about Gamestop. I don't know (and don't care) about any of the other stocks, so you're on your own. **Educate yourself on the company you own a portion of and you'll be less prone to paper hand.** 2. **Don't sell at a loss.** It's just retarded. Fear is one of the worst human emotions and you'll never make money in the market if you're scared of a little red. So if you can't stand that you're down 10% on a stock that swings 50% a day, why did you buy it in the first place? Similarly, if you're down 50% on a stock, it makes no sense to sell it when it pretty much can only go up from there. This isn't to say that stop loss isn't important but I feel like I'll do more harm by trying to explain to you retards on when to use it. So for now, while the hype is still there, just hold. 3. **Only invest what you can afford to lose.** Don't overleverage. Don't use margin. Seriously, if you're struggling to put food on the table and your last $10 are in AMC like a retard, this game really isn't for you. The reason is that you're so scared for your money that you will make the worst possible decisions at the worst time and lose that money. Don't underestimate fear and desperation. This isn't just a get rich quick scheme. 4. **When you're up bigly, congratulations!** You win. Follow the advice for OGs. &#x200B; **If you're an OG and bought Gamestop when it was double digits:** 1. **Congratulations you big chad! :)** 2. **Consider taking a little bit of profit.**",0.0

It’s also somewhat unusual for being an active, fully transparent manager of ETFs. &#x200B; Cathie Wood runs 7 different ETF's (of AT LEAST 1 year in existence) and they all have gone up from 177% to 391% in the last 16 months or from January 1,2020 to present. Only included stocks (ETF's) with 1 or more years history. Did NOT include the ARKX fund or Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF since it is less than 1 month old, with a March 30,2021 inception date. Hard to believe but the results AND charts speak for themselves . &#x200B; Even if you took out the March 2020 LOW prices and went with January 2020 or February 2020 highs (high share prices BEFORE the Covid19 or coronavirus stock market crash of March 2020),the results are nevertheless extremely impressive. &#x200B; High performance over one performance may be attributed to luck by SOME investors but when you consistently have greater than 20% yearly returns over 7 different stocks (or ETF's),then that is WORLD CLASS stock market skill. You are doing something RIGHT. Cathie Wood is a genuinely extraordinary and extremely aggressive stock picker and analyst. No doubt about that.

2021-06-22 07:11:59,"It’s no real secret that inflation is here. And it’s not “transitory.” Especially once wages start increasing, as those are extremely difficult if not impossible to bring back down. Currently there are shortages in everything. Homes, cars, services, computer chips, even my local BBQ place ran out of brisket. Why is this? It’s not because every single thing has happened to have a shortage at the same time, it’s because everything is under priced from it’s fair value. The supply/demand curve that we all learn in high school economics, where it meets in the middle and that creates your price, is currently not in the middle. Places are charging prices that are way too cheap, because they haven’t gotten on board yet / are phasing it slowly to not cause negative PR. In capitalism things should never be out of supply, that means they’re not priced correctly. How to make money on this So you understand that inflation = bad. You also understand indexes going down = bad. So you figure, since both are bad they are correlated. And puts on indexes is the play. If you think this you’re not alone, many hedge funds and large institutions believe this. You all have something in common though, you’re all retarded. Inflation is nuanced. It’s horrible, but there is one good thing to inflation, and the reason the government causes it. It makes stock prices go uppies So if you understand inflation is coming, what do you do? A bull may just begin buying calls on all the indexes, which will most likely pay off. But if you want to maximize profits. You should do the following. Calls on $Commodities Commodities do the best under inflation, as they are the first step in a supply chain, and so the first thing that raises prices. Steel, livestock, these are all exceptionally good plays. Stay away from precious metals, they’re just pure speculation Puts on $TLT When inflation happens, after the initial retard panic selling we saw last week, investors quickly realize they need to be in something (like stocks) to preserve their wealth, and that cash is useless. Bond yields shoot up, and puts on bonds can make a fortune These 2 plays hedge you perfectly for any inflation fears. The worse inflation gets, the more these 2 plays are guaranteed to print.

From Investopedia - *For instance, a market maker in XYZ stock may provide a quote of $10.00-$10.05, 100x500. This means that they bid (they will buy) 100 shares for $10.00 and also offer (they will sell) 500 shares at $10.05. Other market participants may then buy (lift the offer) from the MM at $10.05 or sell to them (hit the bid) at $10.00.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better.

2021-06-23 01:07:50,"This is a DD for a company, Reconnaissance Energy Africa (RECAF) I have been following since mid-January. I haven’t seen it discussed on this sub because it’s market cap is only 1.54 Billion USD. There is A LOT of DD on this company out there that takes weeks to really go through. I’m not going to even try to cover it all, but basically ReconAfrica is an oil exploration company that recently discovered and has 90% rights to the largest undeveloped onshore basin in the world right now, the Kavango Basin, with total petroleum generating potential that’s north of 120 billion barrels of oil. Given it’s current market cap, I believe ReconAfrica is one of the most undervalued stocks in the market, a potential future 10-100 bagger. **Some history on the ReconAfrica**: the company was taken public about two years ago. Back then, all it really had was an aeromagnetic survey showing what the company interpreted to be extremely deep sedimentary basin in the countries of Namibia and Botswana. On the basis of this survey, they had the foresight to purchase drilling rights to over 8 million acres of land for very cheap. Last year Recon purchased a drilling rig and shipped it to Namibia to get more detailed stratigraphic data. The company commended drilling the first well in January/February and are currently midway through the second well. The preliminary results have been very bullish. I am not a geologist but as I understand it, an active petroleum system needs to have a source rock, a seal, and reservoir, and traps in order to be viable. With the data released in the past two months being even better than expected, it looks like all of those components are present and there is potential for huge amounts of extractable oil. A full suite of results from the core samples in the first two wells is expected to be released soon. In future wells, they plan to target an actual oil trap using the seismic data. By the end of 2021, they hope to be entering discussion with Joint Venture partners. Geologically speaking, the Kavango basin is similar to the Permian Basin in Texas (which has over 50 billion barrels of oil and is currently producing 5 million barrels of oil per day). However, the Permian acreage is Texas is divided among dozens of companies. The largest of them Diamondback (FANG), Pioneer (PXD), Concho (CXO), and EOG all have market caps in the tens of billions of dollars. In contrast, ReconAfrica has the rights to the entire basin all to themselves. That is what makes it an incredible opportunity in my opinion. I think the company (currently trading in the $9-$10 range) could be a $100-$200 stock by next year once the exploratory drilling and seismic program is completed and the company enters Joint Venture (JV discussions).

2021-01-30 04:33:25,"**TLDR: Today's movements are a combination of panic around systemic failure Monday, with some selling of winners to buy GME and other meme stocks by the broad market. It's also the VIX/Risk Parity unwind trade happening. My opinions: a) GME would be 4 digits if not for the factors today around calls and shares being hard to buy. So it could be 4 digits Monday, depending upon regulatory actions b) we are risking a real financial crisis here if GME does get to 4 digits, c) the fed & treasury dept are likely to intervene Monday and don't want this bubble, but dare only attack it indirectly, D) there's going to be over-regulation out of this. Positions: was short when I wrote, now long VIX to hedge catastrophe, but strongly long ES into weekend.** We are seeing today is a bunch of things. It's a little similar to what we saw Tuesday and Wednesday - A lot of selling on fear of systemic failure. What is different though is that on Tues/Wed it was hedge funds covering shorts while dropping their winners. You can see this in the movement of GVIP which is an ETF that mechanically picks hedge fund long favorites. It underperformed market dramatically on those days, then overperformed yesterday. Today it is performing around market. You also see winners being dumped by retail to now buy GME - I think that's clear in the chart. Lastly, there's a risk parity trade and momo trade around VIX going on it's fear, risk parity trade, and retail dumping their favorites to buy GME. Explaining all in detail here: **Why I think GME would be 1000+ Today Normally** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 It's hard to buy call options. They are the leverage that makes this go up fast, multiplicatively with the narrow effective float now and the short interest. We aren't gamma squeezing as much, but it's still multiplicative in a way other parts of the trade aren't. Today, there's restricted buy (and IV is realy expensive...), and there are dealers selling 5m net shares as calls roll off (probably), and you can't get options most places... And the stock is still up a ton. That to me means without the unwind, and with options broadly available, and buys unrestricted, we'd be at $1000 today or more. Of course, we all know it's a bubble, and bubbles only sustain as long as net capital to the bubble increases. We surely are near the peak - after which it must unwind. But, regardless of the true outcome, we'd be at a much higher price today if not for all of these negative price dynamics piled on - limited new call options, trading restrictions, Friday option unwind. That leads me to my next point. **Systemic Failure Fears:** This GME thing is allowing a ton of leverage. Shorts leverage the stock with their 140% short. Longs are leveraged on calls. You put those together, and total GME leverage might be 40 or 50 or 60x at times when options were cheap (less now,",0.0

2021-03-15 11:01:34,"# Updated with link to options intro and information at the bottom of the post **I'm going to teach you guys about call/put spreads.** In this guide, we'll use AMC as the example. Let's pretend it is currently trading at $9.28. # First, some terms you should know: Option: a contract that gives you the OPTION to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price) on a certain date Premium: The per-share price paid to the option contract seller for the option Underlying: The stock on which we are trading options Long: Means that we are BUYING an option Short: Means that we are SELLING an option Call: An option contract that gives the LONG side the OPTION to BUY 100 shares of the underlying for a given strike price Put: An option contract that gives the LONG side the OPTION to SELL 100 shares of the underlying for a given strike price &#x200B; Now, how can we make money with a small account balance? # If we have a BULLISH outlook (AMC goes to $13 because Stonks go up 📈📈📈) # 1. YOLO calls (maximum gains, maximum risk): Buy an out-of-the-money (OTM) call for an expiration date and hope the gamble goes your way. **A long $10C 3/26** ($10 dollar strike call expiring on March 26) position trades for a premium of $1.49 a share, which gives us a total price of $149 per contract (100 shares at $1.49 per share). This contract is out of the money - meaning the strike price is above the current trading price. This is a straight up gamble. If AMC doesn't reach the strike price, the option expires worthless, because buying 100 shares at market price will be cheaper than exercising your right to buy 100 shares at the strike price. In that scenario, we have lost the premium we spent to buy the option. As $AMC’s market price approaches the strike price of $10, the option’s value will go up – meaning you could sell the option at a higher premium than you paid for it. However, we will still lose money on this trade if the price doesn’t go above $11.49. That can be calculated by adding our per-share premium to our strike price. Since we paid $1.49 per share for the contract at a $10 strike, we need to recoup the premium of $1.49 per share. Hence the breakeven stock price is $11.49. If AMC manages to hit $13, we’ll be able to exercise the option (and purchase 100 shares at 11.49 each) or sell the contract for the market rate of around $3.00 per share. If we exercise the option, we could immediately sell the 100 shares at market price of $13, earning us $13 - $11.49 = $1.51 per share, or $151 total. **Net investment and max risk: $149 per contract** **Breakeven price: $11.49 ($10 strike + $1.49 premium)** **Net P/L at $13: +151 per contract ($3.00 – $1.49) x 100** &#x200B; # 2.

A few days have passed and central banks all around the world have made it clear that it was in fact, NOT WELCOME. Most importantly, our own FED members finally changed their tune namely with Dally here just near the close : >Fed's Daly On If Monetary Policy Become Less Accommodative Than Appropriate: > >\- Could Address With Tools Like Changing Maturity Of Bond Purchases > >\- Sees QE, Operation Twist As A 'First Tool' > >**- Not Discounting Use Of Yield Curve Control** In bold this is really all we needed to hear to make me go from full gay bear to super bull.

We tried to defeat them on their own domain, with much lower capita. Melvin probably exited their shorts with a huge loss around 80-150 usd on 27/1, that drove the price up, and around the 350+ range where other investors with long positions could surely exit with big gains. Then the hype peaks causing more retail buys, also people looking at the short interest data from 15/1 which is long outdated... The only shorts there are is the ones entered on a high (200+) price point and they sure as hell fine there with the current pricing. If they don't do their broad range of trickery (shutting retail brokers, media narrative manipulation, etc.) it probably would have gone up more but they wanted to shut it down, and guess what, they probably even made some nice money on it.

2021-03-30 05:38:39,"ARKX Launches on March 30th, 2021 and the first 39 holdings have been unveiled today (Monday 29th). At first glance many investors will be surprised and maybe even disappointed not to see more Pure Space companies. Let’s do some digging. From their [website:](https://ark-funds.com/arkx) *Why invest in ARKX* *Exposure to space exploration, including orbital and sub-orbital aerospace, enabling technologies, and beneficiaries of aerospace activities, such as agriculture, Internet access, global positioning system (GPS), construction, and imaging.* *The Adviser defines “Space Exploration” as leading, enabling, or benefitting from technologically enabled products and/or services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.* **why big caps?** such as Amazon, Baba, Google and even Netflix? while one could argue that being big tech companies they would benefit from increased business activity due to a wider broadband coverage through future space constellations (such as Starlink or Space Mobile) it seems that these holdings could actually serve as “cash-like” for a potential future rotation into long-duration space companies. Cathie Wood has explained this process in a video that they sometimes treat FAANGS as cash-like instruments as they are less volatile (per the sub rules I can not link the video so you will have to search the keywords). The presence of US dollar as holding #26 could also be consistent with this idea (keeping cash and liquid lower beta stocks to deploy later when opportunities arise). Note also that Amazon and Baba would profit from an increased use of air drones for last mile delivery (which falls into one of the 4 themes of ARKX specifically Aerospace Beneficiary Companies). **39 holdings so far but aims for 40 to 55**: that’s actually the first thing I’ve noticed. In the Fund Details they write that the typical # of holdings will be 40 to 55. So up to 17 more names could be added assuming USD could be liquidated at some point. **only 2 special pur-pose acqui-sition so far** namely Arch-er and Jo-by which are both very forward-looking air drones companies **and** trading very near their redemption price of $10. This last point seems to me to be the reason why only 2 specials are included so far. Companies like Momen-tus, Space Phones, Black Sky, 🚀 Lab, Astra, Spi-re, could still be in at some point whether before or after their respective business combinations. I believe the safety net of near NAV trading was prioritized given the current increased volatility and risks on growth names (moreover on space tech). **their own 3D Printing ETF** as holding #2. I guess why making it complicated when you can make it simple. ARK said 3D printing is one of the highest growth potential industries in the economy and is set to transform the manufacturing landscape. And it’s absolutely needed for space tech whether it’s printed on earth or beyond. Instead of going for individual names they went for their own ETF. Kind of smart and self-glorifying at the same time. **actual revenue vs future projections**: as value stocks and reopening trade control the narrative right now I also notice that their 36 top holdings",0.0

2021-04-06 06:50:00,"Disclosure: All of the following represents my own opinion. &#x200B; Recently, [LMC](https://lordstownmotors.com/) was [attacked](https://www.businessinsider.com/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-short-seller-hindenburg-report-earnings-2021-3) by short-seller, Hindenburg Research. By now, we all know short-sellers bend the rules and attack volatile stocks so they can make a profit. Ultimately, their goal is to induce Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) especially towards retail investors like us. For this reason, it is critical to do extensive DD before you ever believe a short-report. Think about all of the shorts that lost billions on Tesla last year. People like Cathie Wood, who actually took a deep dive into Tesla’s value proposition and learned the use-cases for their vehicles & technology, are now swimming in money. It’s important to remember that there are 2 sides to every story, especially when a short-seller has a vested interested in a stock price going down. And yes, Hindenburg was the short-seller that helped bring Nikola down from their sky-high valuation last year and exposed them for fraud. However, LMC is *much different* than Nikola. So, in this post, I’m going to do 2 things: 1. Break down some of the many inaccuracies in Hindenburg’s “research report” against LMC. 2. Show you why RIDE stock currently presents an excellent opportunity for both short-term & long-term growth. Okay, let’s get started. &#x200B; **First and foremost, two key people in Ohio recently stepped up to defend LMC from Hindenburg’s allegations.** Per Senator *Michael Rulli*, “(LMC) is way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article has never been in that plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.” U.S. Rep. *Tim Ryan*, who is considering a U.S. Senate run in 2022, didn’t mince words about the short-seller report. *He called it “bull-\*\*\*\*.”* “I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for people to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (LMC) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.” Tim Ryan is spot on. Hindenburg’s report was a bunch of BS filled with fluff to make LMC appear weak in the public eye. &#x200B; **Now, onto an overview of LMC:** GM invested in LMC back in 2019 in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/).

It's down a bit today but it definitely still has room to run to $25 very short term and likely $30 in near term. $MT on the other thanks can likely see around $45-$60 within the year for sure and possibly above that to around 80-100 range when money starts rotating in. This has been a very underappreciated play similar to $CLF that is a ticking time bomb of profits. Another steel stock that is in the exact same position as CLF but as not yet seen a run up is $MT. In late 2020 CLF actually acquired MTs north american steel operations for $1.4 billion dollars. Together they form the largest iron ore pellet producer in North America and they will also dominate the market with profits as they produce steel products throughout the chain as previously seen in the CLF DDs posted before. July 29 is when the Q2 earnings for MT are released so expect the profit to be seen there as the high steel prices have been in effect for the whole quarter at that point above what they were originally estimated to be. Like CLF, MT also saw a stock price of $300 a share in 2008 when the steel prices were at a previous all time high which has now been beat. If you liked the idea of CLF, MT is another great low risk play that you can get into. Both of these, CLF and MT, have very low risk with a very nice upside short, medium, and long term extending into 2022. Current position: 500 commons MT",1.0

While some derivative contracts are opened with the intention of buying or selling the underlying security, traders seeking derivative exposure only must close, roll out, or offset their open positions prior to the close of trading on triple witching days.

2021-06-29 14:55:16,"Background: Quantum-Si came to market through a SPAC. We all know SPACs got destroyed through March and are now starting to come back. Most SPACs are EV, clean energy, digital finance, etc. Usually start ups with little to no revenue, operating at a loss, or futuristic tech that will change the game if it’s true and not a scam. (Nikola) Quantum-Si fits this mold completely with what I said above so that’s the risk factor that comes with it but it’s a one of a kind stock on the market and for some reason people are not talking about it or getting that run up like CCIV, Quantumscape, Chargepoint, CLII, Proterra, etc. Given these are all EV plays this just seems to be a less diluted market with bigger ramifications if this executes. Quantum Si builds a single molecule detection system with their own semiconductors. Basically, think of this as the next CRISPR and helping develop tech and outsource it to other companies for research on genomics. We saw what happened with Intellia Theraputics and CRISPR today with Phase 1 results. Miss Woods just invested a lot of money in them in the last week but take that with a grain of salt we all know the kind of year ARK is having but does give some spotlight on this with saying it could be the future. Again, typical SPAC with a long way to go and grow but a unique opportunity with low share price and many catalysts moving forward.",0.0

Being probably one of the biggest, most retarded apes on this subreddit, and just following along for the ride (and to stick it to the big boys on WS), something nevertheless got me thinking (because even apes have brains, mind you). If say only half of the degenerates of this sub have only ONE share, and the m\*\*\*\*\*f\*\*\*\*\*\* huge squeeze happens at say 50k a share (which is a lot higher than I believe the price to go tbh), then we would have 4mio (rounding it down) people @ 1 share @ 50k, meaning 200 billion dollars that would have to be paid out to retail investors (or us apes to be clear). 200 BILLION, that is on the conservative side. This is not taking into account the current float of about 40mio shares. So I guess my real question is : WHERE tf is that money going to come from to pay us, and WHO tf is going to bleed? Or to formulate it differently : what is one of your fellow apes missing? Thanks for clearing this up. Oh and whatever happens, thanks for hyping me up for the past months, it is an insane ride!

2021-02-05 13:53:51,"But stop blaming your GME losses on Jim Cramer, Robinhood, the SEC, short ladders, whatever else... Complaints about the above can be broken down to this: 1) Cramer and the rest of the news media are in the business of getting eyeballs. Not helping people invest or make money. GME/AMC/whatever else was the hot story so they ran it. Their “advice” is a facade. 2) Robinhood shut down trading in GME and other meme stocks because it became a victim of its own success. They didnt have enough cash to support your trades so they stopped trading. You trusted a startup to handle your investing and you paid the price. Honestly I think you should be grateful they didnt let you buy more at $300/sh. But I realize im arguing with retards here. 3) The SEC is looking into WSB because they think that hedge funds supported and profited off the GME hype. They dont care about your five shares and 💎🙌🏼 memes. Honestly just take one minute and look at the stock chart, are you really surprised the SEC is investigating who might have manipulated the stock UP rather than back down to earth. Get a grip on reality. 4) Short ladders aren’t real and even if they were, they’d only work if there isn’t real investor demand for the stock. And we all know there isnt an iota of real demand at >$50. If the stock was actually worth $1,000 then it would trade at $1,000. Piling into a stock to push a short squeeze is just the inverse so take a look in the mirror and don’t act like you are so righteous. Just like how a short squeeze doesn’t last forever, neither would a ladder. Its clear now which side is “right.” If you lost money on GME its because you got sucked into the hype or got greedy. Perhaps you took a virtuous route and saw a community that tried to take down a bunch of hedge funds. And lets be honest. You won! But very briefly. Melvin’s image will be forever tarnished by this and Wall Street now has to respect the little guys. But this came at the cost of many small investors who might have lost all they had saved up.

If I were a hedge fund right now I would be co-coordinating a fake squeeze. This is the only sure fire and likely way to cause most retail investors to exit their positions. This is also the easiest way for them to join in their fight against us longs and diamond hands. I am certain this will happen soon. What will happen? Hedges will continue to allow the price to rise, 300, 400, 500. By this time the whole world will be back into buying GME and it will potentially go to $900/1000 a share on momentum alone. At this point half of Wallstreet bets (the new paper hands) and potentially this sub WILL sell half, if not all their shares. I don't like this idea anymore than you do but this is likely to happen. Most people have lives and bills to pay and $1000 a share is too attractive. From here, the hedgies, along with the sell off with mass attack the price down easily to probably pre 100 numbers. Much like a month ago, then we will be back to another long wait. This is their only way out. They will be able to buy back shares and would possibly even start shorting again. Sure the main squeeze won't have arrived but this will have put so many shares back into circulation for them. Meaning we will have to wait much longer for the real thing. How does one counter this? Acknowledge this is coming and stop looking at the share price as a number. 💎🙌 forever - this is the only way. You have to be the strongest psychologically you've ever been for an ape.

If they have no users they cannot IPO. This is how they lose money. 2. Stop using Google products: I don't live in the US so I can not confirm this one but I saw yesterday that Google deleted Robinhood reviews. Google is part of the cancel culture (I don't know if Apple did the same). Stop using Android and they will lose like half of their revenue. This is how they lose money. 3. Stop putting money in index funds and start activist investing: BlackRock, Vanguard and the rest of the guys support these hedge funds. Stop paying them comissions, start activist investing (some stocks like Chamath SPACs, etc). This is how they lose money. 4. Ask for Janet Yellen resignation and 800K USD donation: apparently she received 800K USD from Citadel. Oh and she is not ok with cryptocurrencies because some ""bad actors"" use them, but she is ok with receiving money from hedge funds that are suspect of fraud after what happened yesterday.

2021-03-09 08:50:18,"My fellow degenerates, it has come to my attention that Jim Cramer (Virgin), has advised his legion of boomers to sell Palantir Technologies. I am posting this to present a long term bullish case for Palantir, and why I think this recent sell-off is a great buying opportunity. First, I am disputing the reliability of Cramer's picks. According to a 2016 study, the S&P 500 outperformed Cramer by 6% over a 15 year period. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13) . I further contend that most positive performance is due to boomers mindlessly following his advice and thereby contributing to buying pressure, rather than high quality fundamental or technical analysis. Second, Palantir Technologies' Gotham Software is widely used throughout government sectors, and it's Foundry Software is becoming largely incorporated for commercial purposes. Palantir has experienced 40% YoY revenue growth, with analyst forecasts of a 68% revenue increase in 2021, and unlike many high-flying tech companies, has not relied on large amounts of debt to sustain itself. This limits the downside risk, and even has Morningstar assigning it an undervalued rating. We are not known as value investors on this thread, but when companies that should be trading at 3x their so called ""fair value"" are trading below it, it's a good sign for full degenerates. Third, Palantir's RSI is drifting closer to oversold territory, with a 25% increase in shares short since January 29th. The MACD is currently drifting away from the signal line, but we should see bounce back/resistance at around the $20-21 mark, as we did last Friday. This will present a good opportunity for the bulls, as Alex ""The Magic"" Karp kicks the bears back up the stream.",1.0

2021-03-02 13:37:33,"TLDR: The stock is undervalued. WW has a formula for success and new streams of revenue. P\E below average compared to sector. Conservative earning call and positive reaction. 🚀 fueling... giiiiddy up ☝ FUNdamentals: 2020 versus 2019 Revenue down 2.8% Gross Profit down 1.2% Operating income down 24% EPS $1.07 versus $1.72 None of this looks very good. BUT, the market doesn't care about 2020 it cares about 2021 and beyond. 2020 was riddled with complex issues, restructuring, and a rushed business model change. The move to e-commerce and a fully digital environment for WW has major upside. WW has reported a slower growth rate compared to competitors in the digital arena, however they are likely far more profitable and have more to offer from their decades of experience in the industry. Despite all the bad metrics Gross Margin was up yoy. WW is developing new revenue streams in their digital environment and expect to see continued growth. Undervalued, stagnant prior year, meager 2021 forecast. Yet, the market reaction was positive. UP 17.5% after last Thursday's earnings call P/E of 23.89 compared to ~40 for competitors Bottom line: after 60 years of operating a weight loss and lifestyle business primarily out of brick and mortar, WW has begun to transform. Hop on while tickets to the moon are still cheap. Oh yeah, there's also the MEME potential: I don't know how to make a deep fake or what SpongeBob scene best exemplifies the potential of growth here BUT there is definitely a Tom Cruise jumping on the couch screaming at Oprah 'I LOVE THE STOCK' or Oprah handing out money 'YOU GET A STOCK'. get to work...oh and can someone with a bloomberg terminal see if they've been shorted 134%?

Buy the SLV $24 Strike Call (Jan 2023 Expiration) = $4.18 Debit * Sell the SLV $24 Strike Put (Jan 2023 Expiration) = $4.03 Credit * Net cost = *Strike Price Plus Debit Paid* * *(Image includes commission and others, so the net figure is different)* &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/uir81q8d4s971.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=b843ba42427dcd6803699f5c52ac3c5b5200f00d ***Short Synthetic - Bearish/ Mimic 100 shares of SHORT Stock, UNAFFECTED by Greeks*** * Buy ATM Put option * SELL the corresponding Call option, of the same strike AND expiration * E.g. Buy the SLV $24 Strike Put (Jan 2023 Expiration) = $4.03 Debit * Sell the SLV $24 Strike Call (Jan 2023 Expiration) = $4.18 Credit * Net cost = *Strike Price Minus Credit Received (or plus debit paid if the case may be)* &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/5riryjje4s971.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=368facabde1153814360e5867d6229d84fc107bc Now, the obvious risk with a Short Synthetic is the sold call leg, thus the P/L chart showing infinite potential loss. The easiest way to mitigate this is by buying a LOWER Delta Call to cover yourself in the case of a surge higher. The expiration does not need to be the same as the Synthetic, I would instead buy the expiration that is far out enough that I am comfortable with (in this case Sep 17th 2021). &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/8yg74v3g4s971.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=adf67eef5869acb5416cf3aa196ea3ffa1e40a68 ***So Why Use Them?*** * Some of the biggest strength of stock vs. options is the lack of theta decay AND the fixed delta positioning, the other big advantage is the fact that a Synthetic grants exposure to 100 shares of stock WITHOUT the upfront costs (you are still subject to the same P/L as if you HAD bought the shares, so keep this in mind, in a margin account this can result in opening more Synthetics than you have cash to cover, leading to a margin call, be warned), in a margin account therefore this can make the strategy a good way to make efficient use of capital. * In effect you are opening a 100 share position for next to nothing in opening costs, you will still be subject to the price fluctuations of the underlying (THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE NO RISK... THIS MERELY MEANS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FRONT THE CASH FOR THE STOCK). &#x200B; ***Synthetic Covered Calls*** * Remember that a Synthetic mimics 100 Shares of Stock (hence the 100 Delta). * This also allows one to sell CCs AGAINST their Synthetic stock position, whilst still retaining the protective put (lower",0.0

2021-07-04 06:26:41,"Thanks a lot WSB. I mean that. It's been great and I've loved the memes. But shit just got real. Call from the landlord today that the month's rent bounced, which is weird because pay goes in on Thursday before the weekend. He also says there's a courier delivery for me at the front desk. Make a quick call to the ol' Kuwait Finance House (bank), easy to do with the aldhahab line, and they say there's been a ""complete freeze"" on all transactions and will not discuss over the phone. *Already* have a appointment booked for me tomorrow morning with their customer service manager and told me to bring my lawyer. Now... This is quite unusual because if there's one thing about Kuwait (and expeically KFH being an Islamic Bank) is that they are as solid as a rock; their steadfast honesty with money and contracts is the one thing I never worry about here. So the only thing I know as I get into the elevator to go grab my courier delivery is that some deep shit is going on... Enter the courier letter. Without going all legalese (mostly because I don't understand it all), the thing I gather from the letter is that my local Kuwaiti Fucking Bank has frozen everything - accounts, investments, loan payments - pending outcome of some judicial hearings due to some type of documents they've received at the behest of the American Embassy here representing our old friends at BofA. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. Next call was to an attorney and the first two won't have anything to due with me as soon as I said bank freeze and US Embassy. Third company wanted an initial retainer worth more than three month salary but what choice do I have?? Glad I keep a little stashed away for a rainy day but now the kicker after several hours waiting on them: #I've been advised not to travel outside the country!! That's the polite way of saying I *cannot* travel outside the country - my civil ID is blacklisted for border crossings. Just sitting here in a bit of a panic because I'm not a lawyer (my parents were married) but I guess I'll find out more tomorrow. This is all happening so fast. As of right now. Mrs. InKuwait emptied our home safe and is the process of travelling back to her home in Romania. Thanks love. See you when the shit clears, I guess. So, again WSB, you're all I got.

After some adventures with Ol' Yeller, I was up some 30% that could finance an entire charcuterie instead of ramen. It was a blast, and I was ready to YOLO my cheese and my crackers into the sky. Enter $NVAX, with late stage trials that would dominate a deadly baby flu. You see, I had a whole $260, an A in an undergrad portfolio class, and knew nothing about vaccines; it literally could not go tits up. A few days later, as biotech do, my cheese was cut and a thing of dreams. After my cheese portfolio tanked, I though maybe the smart money was on to something. My YOLO didn't take me to the moon, but mooned me instead. Naturally, I joined the dark side. Closed my position, went to grad school, helped write textbooks, taught analysts, and went full corpro. But see, working for the man is not the same as being the man. It took my time, it stressed me away from my high school sweetheart, and it wasn't going to pay enough for studying full time again.

I don’t want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning. 1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade. 2. Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*. 3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead 4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully. 5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time. To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”. Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’.",0.0

2021-06-29 20:59:13,"# DEAR APES, A few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's. Today, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting **STARTED**! The deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc. There's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS: **ENTERTAINMENT** The world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc. TESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry. &#x200B; [TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/aekg7gm3u8871.jpg?width=2243&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643) With autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car. So, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier. Then you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side. On GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. ""Chiplets"" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, with less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated. On console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER. On Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from **GOOGLE** for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal. **AMAZON, TENCENT, ALIBABA, AZURE** (Microsoft), they are all buying chips from AMD. More CORES means MORE power processing, lower energy, lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY (as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre & Meltdown issues). AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96... and also 128. That's just ludicrous, 128 CORES and 256 threads. And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip. [Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/36x8ygt6u8871.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d96e3eab884218203d9fbe906b9ba3474902e13) Deals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC. Last, **but certainly NOT least: MOBILE** AMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. Its GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it",0.0
2021-03-11 06:54:11,"**Disclaimer:** This is not investment advice, this is simply an inside look at the reasoning behind a large investment decision I am personally making. MPLN is one of the most undervalued stocks in the market right now in my humble opinion, and I will attempt to explain why in this post. While major indices sit near all-time-highs this sucker is wallowing near all-time-lows at $6.30 after a merger with a deal price of $10.00 a share. **What is MultiPlan?** MultiPlan helps provide cost savings in the healthcare industry primarily by utilizing their massive size and scale (they work with over 700 payer customers including all the big boys such as UnitedHealth, Cigna, Aetna, etc.) and proprietary IT tools to reduce the cost of out-of-network medical claims for all parties involved. This is a complicated business so I won’t waste time trying to explain it to people who don’t care, but all you need to know is that they saved their customers about $19B in 2020 on medical claims and charged only about $1B to do it (everyone wins – even the patients save $). At $6.30 a share the market cap is less than $4.3B and they have incredibly high cash flow margins on their revenue. They deliver tremendous value and because of their size, scale, and history they have an enormous moat around their massive troves of medical claim data (they processed in excess of $105B worth of claims in 2020 alone). They have long-term contracts and decades long relationships with key major customers. In fact, Warren Buffett actually considered buying MultiPlan in 2013. Instead, they eventually went on to make an $11B deal with Michael Klein in the fall of 2020. **Why is it so low?** Soon after the company’s business combination in October, MuddyWatersResearch put out an inflammatory short report titled “Multiplan: Private Equity Necrophilia Meets The Great 2020 Money Grab” and attempted to attack the stock. This short report has been thoroughly debunked by management (refer to the Q3 2020 earnings call for a detailed breakdown) and analysts alike (Citi called it a fundamentally sound company and initiated a $10 price target). The two analysts who have initiated coverage have given this $11 and $10 price targets and both occurred after the short report. Further, after the business combination they had a massive debt refinancing which required underwriters – nobody is going to allow them to refinance all that debt if there was any truth to MuddyWaters’ claims. In fact, in a recent fireside chat held on January 12th the business combination sponsor Michael Klein reiterated that the short report was BS and suggested that we will see the truth in the company’s future results. **But who cares about MultiPlan?** Institutions and insiders do. Insiders and other institutional holders (including the PIPE investors) own as much as 91% of the roughly 670m shares. Reporting data as of 12/31/20 shows 543.5M shares held by Institutions & Insiders, however you can find in filings that there are an additional 9M shares held in Treasury and some of the holders at",0.0

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB. I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use .

2021-01-30 03:37:42,"I have seen posts about short-sellers; why do they need to close their position? Can't they hold out until the price goes down? They can indeed do that, but they have to pay to borrow those shares, and I got curious, what ARE they paying to not close? So I looked it up and thought I would share. I found this short FAQ on selling short shares providing rough calculations based on the current price of GME, [https://ibkr.info/article/1146](https://ibkr.info/article/1146) I found a rate of 32\~% on GME short Borrow Fee Rate, and I am lazy and assuming 60 million shares of being shorted every day. 60,000,000 shares X $300/share = $18 billion dollars are being borrowed for shorting. $18 Billion \* 32% / 360 days in year = $16 million dollars a day (trading day or not) Roughly, they are losing $300 million a month! Also, the money that they have tied to margin on the short cannot be used elsewhere. If they could have been making 5% somewhere else, they are effectively paying 37% to short GME stock. So you say, ""when will the squeeze happen?"" The better question is WHY the squeeze will happen. At some point, these hedge funds are going to need that money for something else. They are losing 300 million a month. That is assuming the price does not go up. If it goes up any more, they are losing more on interest (the amount they pay in interest is calculated daily). The other problem for them is what happens when they cannot borrow shares anymore. If I decide, I want to sell, and the brokerage has to get the stock back from the short-seller. The short-seller has to go to the market and buy for whatever price is available. In a way, as a stock owner, YOU CAN SET YOUR OWN PRICE. If the liquidity in the market disappears, you can set your price to be $1000, AND THEY HAVE TO PAY IT TO GIVE YOUR STOCK BACK. Holding the stock, you are squeezing hedge funds and market makers for as long as there is no liquidity for GME stock.",0.0

These molecules make the host environment suitable for the survival of Pg by aiding in nutrient acquisition and disable certain immune defenses. There are several types of gingipains (Ref 3): lysine (Kgp) and arginine (RgpA and RgpB).
